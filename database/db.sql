Although new methods of data security are found and existing methods are tried to be improved, cyber threats are becoming more and more scary every day. The only way to get rid of these threats is to strengthen Network security.</p>\n<p>\n	Network security can be defined as preventive measures taken to protect the network infrastructure against unwanted changes, malfunctions, destruction of data and unauthorized access. Various devices are used to take these precautions.</p>\n<p>\n	A network security strategy should focus on three main points: Protection, detection and response. Protection encompasses all tools designed to counter any threat to network security and prevent unauthorized access. Detection refers to resources that enable to analyze network traffic and identify problems quickly. Response is the ability to react to identified threats and quickly resolve them.</p>\n<p>\n	So, <strong>with which devices will we ensure Network Security</strong>? Let&#39;s take a look at a few of the most used methods</p>\n<p>\n	Our first and most important tool is <strong>Firewall</strong>. Firewalls are security control software / devices between your local network and the external network. Information such as which data packets will pass and which passwords will be passed within the pre-determined policies, and which passwords will be verified are added to the firewall rule tables. In this way, the person and information traffic reaching the system is taken under control. The rules on the firewall determine who can and cannot enter the inside / outside systems, which computers and which services can be used by those who enter.</p>\n<p>\n	Our second device is <strong>VPN</strong>, in other words <strong>Virtual Private Networks</strong>. Virtual private network or vpn is an Internet technology that enables connection to different networks through remote access. Because VPN creates a virtual network extension, a device connected to the network using VPN can exchange data over that network as if it were physically connected. Thanks to VPN, we can both reduce our costs and move PCs and LANs in different places, which we could not do because they were previously unsafe and expensive, to the same platforms over the internet. In this way, it is possible for us to connect to our company while at home, access company resources, check our e-mails and use the Intranet as if we were there.</p>\n<p>\n	Another security measure is to use an <strong>Antivirus Software</strong>. Antivirus software, or antivirus software, also known as anti-malware, is a computer program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware. E-mail, http and ftp traffic, which are the services where viruses are most spread, are directed to the antivirus gateway based on the firewall logic. After the scanning process here, it is directed to the necessary places. With this system, viruses from outside are prevented. With the antivirus system installed on mail servers, viruses circulating in the local network via e-mail are deactivated.</p>\n<p>\n	Again, one of the very effective defense methods is to use <strong>IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)</strong>. IDS (Intrusion Detection System) generally appears in two types; Server based IDS and Network based IDS. Intrusion Detection Systems continuously scan network traffic and analyze the results. In this way, any type of attack can be identified and responded quickly. IDS usually maintains a database of known attack methods to be able to quickly recognize attacks and threats and take quick action.</p>\n<p>\n	Another powerful tool we can use for network protection is <strong>Anomaly Detection</strong>. Network Anomaly Detection Engines, in other words ADE, allow the network to be analyzed so that if any breach occurs in the network, we are alerted quickly enough to respond.</p>\n<p>\n	Finally, we can mention <strong>Network Segmentation</strong> as an important Network security measure. There are many types of network traffic, each associated with different security risks. Network Segmentation allows us to reach the right traffic without risk while limiting the traffic from risky and suspicious sources.</p>\n<p>\n	Reliable network security software and hardware, combined with the right policies and smart strategies, can minimize the impact of cyberattacks and eliminate concerns about Network security.</p>\n', 'With the digital age dominating our lives and the increasing interest in technology, data security has become an even more priority issue.

In this way, it is possible for us to connect to our company while at home, access company resources, check our e-mails and use the Intranet as if we were there.</p>\n<p>\n	Another security measure is to use an <strong>Antivirus Software</strong>. Antivirus software, or antivirus software, also known as anti-malware, is a computer program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware. E-mail, http and ftp traffic, which are the services where viruses are most spread, are directed to the antivirus gateway based on the firewall logic.

What Are The Benefits For Your Business?', 3, 'blog/what_is_sase.jpg', '', '<p>\n	<strong>SASE</strong>, also known as Secure Access Service Edge, is a cyber security network that manages to combine WAN and security system into a single cloud-based system. <strong>SASE</strong> provides security service for all network applications as well as user connection. It can connect to multiple clouds using internet connections, thus providing a scalable solution for growing businesses. The system delivers data directly to the connection source, eliminating the need for an enterprise data center.</p>\n<p>\n	So what benefits does <strong>SASE</strong> provide us in our business?</p>\n<h2>\n	Cost Reduction</h2>\n<p>\n	With SASE, businesses can offer more services and technologies through a single service provider instead of two or more, thus reducing the cost of device and unnecessary network complexity.</p>\n<p>\n	Reducing network complexity means reducing the workload of IT staff. Therefore, SASE significantly reduces IT staffing costs while providing continuous coverage for network performance monitoring and security threat monitoring and response. SASE will also significantly reduce the operational load, as it does not require investment in new hardware and software.</p>\n<h2>\n	WAN Flexibility and IT Agility</h2>\n<p>\n	<strong>SASE</strong> provides great flexibility within the WAN infrastructure. While traditional solutions require a lot of time and resources to scale up and down, a cloud-based SASE solution minimizes the IT burden, making procurement processes as easy as possible.</p>\n<p>\n	Using SASE, IT can get a site online in minutes instead of weeks as on a traditional WAN. It also means less physical hardware need, less downtime and fewer additional software licenses. With these enhanced efficiencies, IT can assign staff to higher priority tasks such as security and network monitoring.</p>\n<h2>\n	Increased Security</h2>\n<p>\n	<strong>SASE</strong> improves security in a variety of ways. First, you can block or restrict access to certain data by applying data protection methods. SASE can also make your network fully visible. In addition to all this, SASE can successfully fulfill its task of securely connecting IoT devices, which normally have a minimum of security.</p>\n<h2>\n	Improving Network Performance</h2>\n<p>\n	SASE&#39;s continuous network monitoring reveals the quality and performance of all connections, including virtual cloud environments and those in the data center. <strong>SASE</strong> paints a real-time picture of all inbound and outbound connections on a single portal or network interface.</p>\n<h2>\n	Greater Transparency and Visibility</h2>\n<p>\n	Network risk assessment can be an extremely complex and ongoing process. The environment will constantly change as connections are initiated and disconnected. What organizations need to do here is to try to understand and solve the interactions of their users, devices, applications and services, thereby minimizing the risk. <strong>SASE</strong> also comes into play here and gathers a multitude of functions in a single point, thus providing network and security transparency. This transparency is a very important detail for organizations as it will reduce the number of software agents needed and provide consistent network visibility.</p>\n<p>\n	As a result, data is dispersed beyond a local data center as cloud services and remote work are becoming more common. For this reason, it has become a mandatory situation for companies to secure their data in every environment. <strong>SASE</strong> offers an extremely efficient and easy way to overcome this security issue. With its simplification of WAN deployment and the solid security measures it provides, <strong>SASE</strong> is a very important solution for all companies in this period.</p>\n', 'SASE, also known as Secure Access Service Edge, is a cyber security network that manages to combine WAN and security system into a single cloud-based system.

Industrial PCs have higher reliability and precision standards than normal PCs and are generally much more expensive than regular PCs. Usually they use complex instruction sets like x86, otherwise reduced instruction sets like ARM. First Industrial PC produced by IBM which has released 5531 Industrial Computer in 1984.</p>\n<p>\n	Many of the technical features of an IPC (industrial PC) and desktop computer such as&nbsp; microprocessor and RAM type, storage medium, interface ports, performance, etc. are actually basically the same. However, the most important feature of industrial PCs is that they are designed to be used in difficult environmental environments such as production facilities.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Industrial computers</strong> mostly used in the following applications to be used in all kinds of applications.</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Evaluation, statistical process control and automatic machine equipment control applications for data collection</li>\n	<li>\n		Stand-alone or network controller for data collection applications</li>\n	<li>\n		Process equipment, motion control</li>\n	<li>\n		Production, cell controllers</li>\n	<li>\n		General automation and factory applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<strong>The Difference of Industrial PC and Standard (Desktop or Laptop) Type Computers</strong></p>\n<p>\n	The <strong>industrial computer</strong> is specifically designed to withstand harsh workshop environment conditions (extreme temperature, dust, humidity, vibration, energy fluctuations) where standard computers cannot be fully qualified. For this reason, an industrial computer should be chosen instead of a normal computer, especially in production environments.</p>\n<p>\n	The following principles should be taken into account in the selection of computers for the production areas of industrial computers.</p>\n<h2>\n	Physical Durability</h2>\n<p>\n	<strong>Temperature:</strong> While normal computers are resistant to 35 &deg; C, industrial computers can operate in environments with ambient temperatures up to 45-50 &deg; C.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Liquid / Dust Protection: </strong>For panel PCs, IP66 or at least IP65 protection class should be provided on the outer front surface, and IP21 protection class should be provided for PCs to be used inside box type panels.</p>\n<p>\n	Some models of industrial computers are fanless, some are provided with cooling fans, which are provided with dust protection, with special filters mounted on the casing externally, usually to keep dust and other similar dirt. Dust protection is at a higher level than standard computers, especially thanks to protection classes such as IP65 - IP66.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Memory Units: </strong>Magnetic media (floppy disk, hard disk, CDROM), cooling system components directly and power supply</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Shock Impact / Vibration Protection: </strong>Disk drives are mounted with shock absorbers providing cushioning and mechanical insulation.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Humidity: </strong>Liquid contaminants / coolants frequently used in production and machine environments (sanding machines, machining centers, transfer lines, lathes etc.) negatively affect the computer in the facility. You can reach high relative humidity values with the industrial PC.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Supply Unit: </strong>Peak, fluctuating, transient voltages and noise generated by AC power supplies are very common in factory environments. The power supply of computers must be provided under all conditions and always with clean, non-variable DC voltages.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Electromagnetic Compatibility: </strong>Proper grounding, protective and proper insulation and electrical design must be provided in accordance with internationally accepted electrical standards.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Expandability and longevity: </strong>An IPC configuration provides different usage areas compared to the standard PC configuration with the expandable slots it provides. In addition, since they are more durable (for example, varnished motherboards, vibration-proof memory units, SSD (Solid State disks) using MLC (Multi Layer Cell) technology), they have a long working life.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Certifications: </strong>Industrial computers must offer certifications in addition to CE certification, which guarantees that they will be less affected by electrical noise in the environment.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Test Reports: </strong>The most important document proving that a computer is industrial is the test reports to be submitted by the manufacturer. Each manufacturer must test its product for heat, vibration, aging, water and dust resistance. It should also be able to present to the customer when requested.</p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-left: 0.6pt;\">\n	Processor</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	When purchasing an industrial computer, criteria such as the strongest and fastest processor and the highest RAM are demanded when purchasing a normal computer. Because the aim is to ensure that it is suitable for the software that will be updated over time. Therefore, users do not hesitate to strain their budgets while purchasing a computer. However, the vast majority of industrial computers do not see updates after they start to work at the point of application and are not used in different areas. For this reason, when choosing an industrial computer, not the top model processor, but a &quot;sufficient&quot; level processor should be selected.</p>\n<p>\n	Today, industrial PCs are widely used in many areas, from industrial automation to data collection, from transportation to defense, from kiosks to markets. The development of industrial computers also shows the progress in science and technology. In the future, the industrial market will continue to evolve with increasing expectations. Currently, users are looking for convenience, speed and efficiency.

Applications of embedded computers can range from Industrial Automation, Digital Signage, Self-autonomous Vehicles, to Space Exploration, and more.</p>\n<p>\n	Typically <a href=\"https://refine-tr.com/en/lanner-products/embedded-box-pcs\"><strong>embedded computers</strong></a> are hardened devices as their use cases tend to be mostly in challenging harsh environment conditions, such as extreme temperature, vibration, shock, dust and humidity.</p>\n<p>\n	There are various types of embedded computers, from rugged industrial box PCs to panel PCs, mini PCs, industrial rackmount server, vehicle computers, and IoT gateways.</p>\n<p>\n	The main differences between an embedded and a desktop computer are purpose and design. Embedded computers are purposeful and dedicated equipment built from scratch to perform a specific task. It can run at maximum, with low resources, and withstand harsh conditions &mdash; something not possible with the consumer-grade computers.</p>\n<p>\n	Another crucial distinction is that the general-purpose desktops come with traditional motherboards, which allow you to expand or replace its components. Embedded computers, on the other hand, have all of its components burned-in in a single Printed Circuit Board (PCB) or Motherboard.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Among the many benefits of Embedded Box PCs are;</strong></p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Small Form Factor:</strong>&nbsp;One of the standout features of nearly all embedded computers is their size. Often built around small form factor motherboards like Mini-ITX&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.onlogic.com/computers/nuc/\" target=\"_blank\">I</a>ntel&#39;s NUC, embedded computers can be installed in places where antiquated towers would never fit. Solid state storage and flexible mounting options also allow embedded PCs to be utilized in virtually any position or orientation.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> In many instances embedded computers, as their name suggests, live deep inside complex systems, making reliability incredibly important. Industrial computers are engineered to provide 24 hour, uninterrupted operation, often employing carefully engineered, fanless and ventless enclosures designed to efficiently dissipate heat while protecting internal components from environmental damage ranging from dust and airborne debris to extreme temperatures, moisture and vibration.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Highly Reliable:</strong> Some embedded computers are designed for high reliability in critical mission-based applications like industrial or military deployments. They need to operate 24&times;7 in demanding applications and extreme environments like rugged terrains, continuous vibration, high temperatures, etc. These embedded computers can operate at a wide range of temperatures (e.g. -30&deg;C to 70&deg;C), dust-proof, and with protection from humidity.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Power Efficiency:</strong> Some applications require that embedded computers remain operational, day and night. That is why these computers are designed for power efficiency. Embedded computers come with lightweight and dedicated software so they do not need lots of processing power. Another advantage of power consumption is that some embedded computers come without fans and don&rsquo;t have any moving components.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>There are also various types of Embedded Box PC which are;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong>The Rugged Industrial Box PC: </strong>The Rugged Industrial Box is excellent for applications that require processing power in harsh environment conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong>The Panel PC: </strong>The Panel PC comes with an integrated display screen that allows interface with the computer and to resist shock and toxic chemicals.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong>The Mini PC:</strong> The mini-PC, although it is not compute-intensive, it can bring some intelligence to rough small and confined spaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong>The Industrial Rackmount Server: </strong>Opposite to the mini-pc, the Industrial Rackmount can be used as a high intensive-compute and racked on top of other servers, without the need of A/C or optimal environments</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong>The Vehicle Computer: </strong>The in-vehicle computer comes with wireless communication and vibrant-resistant capabilities to be used in first emergency-response vehicles, or similar applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong>The IoT Gateway: </strong>The IoT gateway is a type of embedded computer that can act as a bridge between different technologies. It accepts inputs from IoT sensors or video cameras, processes the data, and can output to a display, actuator, or the Internet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	The way computers operate within the industry is not the same as how they are used at home or at the office. The industry has different requirements and standards that demand another kind of computer.</p>\n<p>\n	The embedded computers are designed with the application in mind.

A network appliance can be used for two-factor user authentication to eliminate the need to purchase, install and maintain a separate software-based authentication solution.</p>\n<h3>\n	<strong><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Caching</span></strong></h3>\n<p>\n	Using a network appliance to store local copies of web pages, videos or other objects will save bandwidth and allow users to access cached content much faster. In some cases, companies also use caching services to track web usage of network users.</p>\n<h3>\n	<strong><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">DNS, DHCP, AND IPAM (DDI)</span></strong></h3>\n<p>\n	<strong>Network appliances</strong> are also often used for critical network services such as DNS, DHCP, and IP address management (collectively known as DDI) to ensure high availability and security for your infrastructure.</p>\n<h3>\n	<strong><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Failover</span></strong></h3>\n<p>\n	If your network is unable to meet downtime or other distruptions, it is necessary to make sure that the network application has failover capabilities. When the device detects an outage in your ISP, the failover should be activated automatically and provide one or more alternative connection methods (a different ISP, cellular, satellite, etc.).</p>\n<h3>\n	<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Firewall protection</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	Using a <strong>network appliance</strong> for firewall protection allows you to create a barrier between your own network and the internet. Thus, you can monitor incoming and outgoing traffic to your network and easily block unwanted connections according to the criteria you define.</p>\n<h3>\n	<strong><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Global WiFi settings</span></strong></h3>\n<p>\n	Using a network device, it is possible to manage settings of wireless networks such as broadcast channel, frequency, bandwidth, load balancing, access point and security.</p>\n<h3>\n	<strong><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Intrusion detection</span></strong></h3>\n<p>\n	Malicious activity is extremely common and using a network appliance to detect intrusion is of paramount importance. The application will monitor and report activity and policy violations. Intrusion detection, unlike the firewall service, can also alert you to malicious activity on your network.</p>\n<h3>\n	<strong><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Network Appliance Management</span></strong></h3>\n<p>\n	A network device is usually managed through a browser interface, allowing network administrators to manage their services from anywhere and get up-to-date reports whenever they want.</p>\n<h2>\n	Network Appliance Benefits</h2>\n<p>\n	There are several advantages to using a network device rather than using general purpose servers or computers:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Easy to deploy, operate and manage</li>\n	<li>\n		Compatible with almost any network connected device</li>\n	<li>\n		Purposeful in optimizing performance, security and scalability</li>\n	<li>\n		Cost effective</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	Each network is unique in its infrastructure, needs, and vulnerabilities. In sum, a network appliance is everything a network needs to be efficient, available, and secure.</p>\n', 'A network appliance is a centralizing machine that brings together hardware, software, and services for a group or a network.', NULL),

In the modern world, vehicles owe their smooth operation to more than 50 microprocessor in-vehicle computers. On-board computers help drivers in a wide range of tasks, from securing the vehicle to saving fuel, from navigation to assisted braking, and make driving fun. This new technology has also saved many lives when it comes to accidents. Vehicles today are rapidly turning into a computer on wheels.</p>\n<p>\n	So what are all these computers in vehicles actually doing? It is possible to divide their aims into a few simple categories.</p>\n<h2>\n	Vehicle Computers</h2>\n<h3>\n	<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Advanced Diagnostics</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	The biggest benefits of the large number of sensors and microprocessors in your vehicle are that it is now very easy to determine the causes of problems your vehicle is experiencing. Sensors are used to observe and detect a wide range of different systems, including fuel / air mixture, sparks and much more. When one of these sensors detects any problems, it usually causes an dashboard light, such as a check engine light, to come on.</p>\n<h3>\n	<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Entertainment</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	In vehiche computers used in many vehicle entertainment and information systems such as GPS, video games, TVs, Internet radio and bluetooth compatibility. In-vehicle computers are very convenient, for example, to keep children busy or to create a hands-free environment while using your phone or music player, ensuring a safe ride. Today&#39;s on-board computers offer much more than a ride for everyone and also act as a source of entertainment.</p>\n<h3>\n	<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Safety </strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	The use of computers in vehicles has made transportation much safer than before. Airbags, assisted braking, rear view cameras and more are activated by computer sensors that detect problems in the smallest fraction of a second. This is why airbags can be deployed faster than the actual event of the collision.</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong>ABS</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-left:17.4pt;\">\n	Automatic braking systems (ABS) are a standard feature on most modern cars. If you don&rsquo;t respond to a sudden braking situation fast enough your ABS works to help you avoid a crash, and reduce the severity of a crash. The system essentially works to have the car&rsquo;s computer take over and brake for the driver.</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong>Backup Cameras</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-left:17.4pt;\">\n	Backup cameras are becoming more and more commonplace in the cars on the road. These backup cameras can provide aid to the driver when getting in and out of parking spaces and driveways. These cameras are designed to help drivers avoid backup collisions.</p>\n<h3>\n	<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Emission Controls</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	Another great benefit of in-car computers is that they help reduce pollution. Automakers are using in-car computers to ensure less smoke generation, which saves drivers time and money while also helping to protect the environment. On-board computers ensure that regulations for emission and fuel efficiency standards are properly met.</p>\n<p>\n	Before the emission laws were passed, it was possible to build a car without a computer. But now, due to the new laws, all vehicles have at least one computer system called ECM. This system is responsible for monitoring engine emissions and adjusting the vehicle engine to keep emission levels low. This system receives the following information from different sensors in the vehicle;</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Oxygen Sensor</li>\n	<li>\n		Air Pressure Sensor</li>\n	<li>\n		Air Temperature Sensor</li>\n	<li>\n		Engine Temperature Sensor</li>\n	<li>\n		Throttle Position Sensor</li>\n	<li>\n		Knock Sensor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	Using information from these different sensors, the on-board computer organizes different systems such as fuel injectors, spark plugs, idle speed, and more. Thanks to these regulations, your vehicle can keep emissions as low as possible.</p>\n<p>\n	It can be said that the automotive industry is experiencing one of the biggest periods of change. There are an increasing number of computers inside vehicles to power new technology, and this trend does not seem to be slowing down.</p>\n<p>\n	It would not be wrong to say that modern vehicles, especially high-quality, luxury vehicles and cars with more features for driver comfort and convenience have now become massive computer systems that drive on wheels. The more comfort you want to have in your car, the more computer technology you need to use.</p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"https://refine-tr.com\">https://refine-tr.com</a></p>\n', 'The first computers began to be used in automobiles in the 1970s to perform basic functions such as gearbox shifting and ignition timing.', NULL);

Applications of embedded computers can range from Industrial Automation, Digital Signage, Self-autonomous Vehicles, to Space Exploration, and more.</p>\n<p>\n	Typically <a href=\"https://refine-tr.com/en/lanner-products/embedded-box-pcs\"><strong>embedded computers</strong></a> are hardened devices as their use cases tend to be mostly in challenging harsh environment conditions, such as extreme temperature, vibration, shock, dust and humidity.</p>\n<p>\n	There are various types of embedded computers, from rugged industrial box PCs to panel PCs, mini PCs, industrial rackmount server, vehicle computers, and IoT gateways.</p>\n<p>\n	The main differences between an embedded and a desktop computer are purpose and design. Embedded computers are purposeful and dedicated equipment built from scratch to perform a specific task. It can run at maximum, with low resources, and withstand harsh conditions &mdash; something not possible with the consumer-grade computers.</p>\n<p>\n	Another crucial distinction is that the general-purpose desktops come with traditional motherboards, which allow you to expand or replace its components. Embedded computers, on the other hand, have all of its components burned-in in a single Printed Circuit Board (PCB) or Motherboard.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Among the many benefits of Embedded Box PCs are;</strong></p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Small Form Factor:</strong>&nbsp;One of the standout features of nearly all embedded computers is their size. Often built around small form factor motherboards like Mini-ITX&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.onlogic.com/computers/nuc/\" target=\"_blank\">I</a>ntel&#39;s NUC, embedded computers can be installed in places where antiquated towers would never fit. Solid state storage and flexible mounting options also allow embedded PCs to be utilized in virtually any position or orientation.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> In many instances embedded computers, as their name suggests, live deep inside complex systems, making reliability incredibly important. Industrial computers are engineered to provide 24 hour, uninterrupted operation, often employing carefully engineered, fanless and ventless enclosures designed to efficiently dissipate heat while protecting internal components from environmental damage ranging from dust and airborne debris to extreme temperatures, moisture and vibration.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Highly Reliable:</strong> Some embedded computers are designed for high reliability in critical mission-based applications like industrial or military deployments. They need to operate 24&times;7 in demanding applications and extreme environments like rugged terrains, continuous vibration, high temperatures, etc. These embedded computers can operate at a wide range of temperatures (e.g. -30&deg;C to 70&deg;C), dust-proof, and with protection from humidity.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Power Efficiency:</strong> Some applications require that embedded computers remain operational, day and night. That is why these computers are designed for power efficiency. Embedded computers come with lightweight and dedicated software so they do not need lots of processing power. Another advantage of power consumption is that some embedded computers come without fans and don&rsquo;t have any moving components.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>There are also various types of Embedded Box PC which are;</strong></p>\n<p>\n	<strong>The Rugged Industrial Box PC: </strong>The Rugged Industrial Box is excellent for applications that require processing power in harsh environment conditions.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>The Panel PC: </strong>The Panel PC comes with an integrated display screen that allows interface with the computer and to resist shock and toxic chemicals.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>The Mini PC:</strong> The mini-PC, although it is not compute-intensive, it can bring some intelligence to rough small and confined spaces.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>The Industrial Rackmount Server: </strong>Opposite to the mini-pc, the Industrial Rackmount can be used as a high intensive-compute and racked on top of other servers, without the need of A/C or optimal environments</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>The Vehicle Computer: </strong>The in-vehicle computer comes with wireless communication and vibrant-resistant capabilities to be used in first emergency-response vehicles, or similar applications.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>The IoT Gateway: </strong>The IoT gateway is a type of embedded computer that can act as a bridge between different technologies. It accepts inputs from IoT sensors or video cameras, processes the data, and can output to a display, actuator, or the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n	The way computers operate within the industry is not the same as how they are used at home or at the office. The industry has different requirements and standards that demand another kind of computer.</p>\n<p>\n	The embedded computers are designed with the application in mind.

The environment will constantly change as connections are initiated and disconnected. What organizations need to do here is to try to understand and solve the interactions of their users, devices, applications and services, thereby minimizing the risk. <strong>SASE</strong> also comes into play here and gathers a multitude of functions in a single point, thus providing network and security transparency. This transparency is a very important detail for organizations as it will reduce the number of software agents needed and provide consistent network visibility.</p>\n<p>\n	As a result, data is dispersed beyond a local data center as cloud services and remote work are becoming more common. For this reason, it has become a mandatory situation for companies to secure their data in every environment. <strong>SASE</strong> offers an extremely efficient and easy way to overcome this security issue. With its simplification of WAN deployment and the solid security measures it provides, <strong>SASE</strong> is a very important solution for all companies in this period.</p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"https://refine-tr.com\">https://refine-tr.com</a></p>\n', 'SASE, also known as Secure Access Service Edge, is a cyber security network that manages to combine WAN and security system into a single cloud-based system.

Although new methods of data security are found and existing methods are tried to be improved, cyber threats are becoming more and more scary every day. The only way to get rid of these threats is to strengthen Network security.</p>\n<p>\n	Network security can be defined as preventive measures taken to protect the network infrastructure against unwanted changes, malfunctions, destruction of data and unauthorized access. Various devices are used to take these precautions.</p>\n<p>\n	A network security strategy should focus on three main points: Protection, detection and response. Protection encompasses all tools designed to counter any threat to network security and prevent unauthorized access. Detection refers to resources that enable to analyze network traffic and identify problems quickly. Response is the ability to react to identified threats and quickly resolve them.</p>\n<p>\n	So, <strong>with which devices will we ensure Network Security</strong>? Let&#39;s take a look at a few of the most used methods</p>\n<p>\n	Our first and most important tool is <strong>Firewall</strong>. Firewalls are security control software / devices between your local network and the external network. Information such as which data packets will pass and which passwords will be passed within the pre-determined policies, and which passwords will be verified are added to the firewall rule tables. In this way, the person and information traffic reaching the system is taken under control. The rules on the firewall determine who can and cannot enter the inside / outside systems, which computers and which services can be used by those who enter.</p>\n<p>\n	Our second device is <strong>VPN</strong>, in other words <strong>Virtual Private Networks</strong>. Virtual private network or vpn is an Internet technology that enables connection to different networks through remote access. Because VPN creates a virtual network extension, a device connected to the network using VPN can exchange data over that network as if it were physically connected. Thanks to VPN, we can both reduce our costs and move PCs and LANs in different places, which we could not do because they were previously unsafe and expensive, to the same platforms over the internet. In this way, it is possible for us to connect to our company while at home, access company resources, check our e-mails and use the Intranet as if we were there.</p>\n<p>\n	Another security measure is to use an <strong>Antivirus Software</strong>. Antivirus software, or antivirus software, also known as anti-malware, is a computer program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware. E-mail, http and ftp traffic, which are the services where viruses are most spread, are directed to the antivirus gateway based on the firewall logic. After the scanning process here, it is directed to the necessary places. With this system, viruses from outside are prevented. With the antivirus system installed on mail servers, viruses circulating in the local network via e-mail are deactivated.</p>\n<p>\n	Again, one of the very effective defense methods is to use <strong>IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)</strong>. IDS (Intrusion Detection System) generally appears in two types; Server based IDS and Network based IDS. Intrusion Detection Systems continuously scan network traffic and analyze the results. In this way, any type of attack can be identified and responded quickly. IDS usually maintains a database of known attack methods to be able to quickly recognize attacks and threats and take quick action.</p>\n<p>\n	Another powerful tool we can use for network protection is <strong>Anomaly Detection</strong>. Network Anomaly Detection Engines, in other words ADE, allow the network to be analyzed so that if any breach occurs in the network, we are alerted quickly enough to respond.</p>\n<p>\n	Finally, we can mention <strong>Network Segmentation</strong> as an important Network security measure. There are many types of network traffic, each associated with different security risks. Network Segmentation allows us to reach the right traffic without risk while limiting the traffic from risky and suspicious sources.</p>\n<p>\n	Reliable network security software and hardware, combined with the right policies and smart strategies, can minimize the impact of cyberattacks and eliminate concerns about Network security.</p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"https://refine-tr.com\">https://refine-tr.com</a></p>\n', 'With the digital age dominating our lives and the increasing interest in technology, data security has become an even more priority issue.', NULL),

In addition to all this, SASE can successfully fulfill its task of securely connecting IoT devices, which normally have a minimum of security.</p>\n<h2>\n	Improving Network Performance</h2>\n<p>\n	SASE&#39;s continuous network monitoring reveals the quality and performance of all connections, including virtual cloud environments and those in the data center. <strong>SASE</strong> paints a real-time picture of all inbound and outbound connections on a single portal or network interface.</p>\n<h2>\n	Greater Transparency and Visibility</h2>\n<p>\n	Network risk assessment can be an extremely complex and ongoing process. The environment will constantly change as connections are initiated and disconnected. What organizations need to do here is to try to understand and solve the interactions of their users, devices, applications and services, thereby minimizing the risk. <strong>SASE</strong> also comes into play here and gathers a multitude of functions in a single point, thus providing network and security transparency. This transparency is a very important detail for organizations as it will reduce the number of software agents needed and provide consistent network visibility.</p>\n<p>\n	As a result, data is dispersed beyond a local data center as cloud services and remote work are becoming more common. For this reason, it has become a mandatory situation for companies to secure their data in every environment. <strong>SASE</strong> offers an extremely efficient and easy way to overcome this security issue. With its simplification of WAN deployment and the solid security measures it provides, <strong>SASE</strong> is a very important solution for all companies in this period.</p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"https://refine-tr.com\">https://refine-tr.com</a></p>\n<p>\n	Lanner Electronics: <a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'SASE, also known as Secure Access Service Edge, is a cyber security network that manages to combine WAN and security system into a single cloud-based system.

More specifically, network devices act as intermediaries for data transfer in a computer network.</p>\n<p>\n	The equipment range of network devices is extremely wide. These equipment may include core network components that serve to interconnect other network components, hybrid components, and hardware or software components located at different ports of the network.</p>\n<p>\n	Network devices can be classified according to their location and role in the network.</p>\n<p>\n	To briefly introduce the most commonly used and most well-known components among these;</p>\n<h2>\n	Gateway</h2>\n<p>\n	It can be said that Gateway is a network hardware that provides communication between data between two networks through different network protocols. We can also think of Gateway as an interpreter who helps two people who do not speak the same language or have difficulty communicating to understand each other.</p>\n<h2>\n	Router</h2>\n<p>\n	Router is a network device that establishes and directs communication between two networks. We can define this as the seamless delivery of a data packet from one station to another. Routers can be considered among the most important computer network equipment that maintains network traffic.</p>\n<h2>\n	Switch</h2>\n<p>\n	Network Switch, also known as Switch, is one of the network devices that allow computers and other network components to be connected to each other. It helps different nodes on the network to communicate in a healthy and direct way.</p>\n<h2>\n	Bridge</h2>\n<p>\n	It is a network device that connects two computer networks into one. It is mostly used to connect ethernet or token-ring-based networks. It can act as a hardware on its own, as well as act as a bridge with a suitable software or operating system support.</p>\n<h2>\n	Hub</h2>\n<p>\n	The hub is tasked with connecting multiple computer network devices together. It also works as a repeater to amplify distorted signals. There are two types of Hubs; simple and multi-port.</p>\n<h2>\n	Firewall</h2>\n<p>\n	Firewall is a hardware-based network security system that controls outbound packet traffic to the network based on a rule set. With many different filtering features, it keeps the internet traffic of the computer and the network, including incoming and outgoing packets, under control.</p>\n<p>\n	Having a solid knowledge and understanding of networking devices can enable you to design and implement a network that serves you well, for your personal or corporate purposes. To ensure the security and usefulness of the network, you must monitor the network equipment very closely.

Industrial PCs have higher reliability and precision standards than normal PCs and are generally much more expensive than regular PCs. Usually they use complex instruction sets like x86, otherwise reduced instruction sets like ARM. First Industrial PC produced by IBM which has released 5531 Industrial Computer in 1984.</p>\n<p>\n	Many of the technical features of an IPC (industrial PC) and desktop computer such as&nbsp; microprocessor and RAM type, storage medium, interface ports, performance, etc. are actually basically the same. However, the most important feature of industrial PCs is that they are designed to be used in difficult environmental environments such as production facilities.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Industrial computers</strong> mostly used in the following applications to be used in all kinds of applications.</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Evaluation, statistical process control and automatic machine equipment control applications for data collection</li>\n	<li>\n		Stand-alone or network controller for data collection applications</li>\n	<li>\n		Process equipment, motion control</li>\n	<li>\n		Production, cell controllers</li>\n	<li>\n		General automation and factory applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<strong>The Difference of Industrial PC and Standard (Desktop or Laptop) Type Computers</strong></p>\n<p>\n	The <strong>industrial computer</strong> is specifically designed to withstand harsh workshop environment conditions (extreme temperature, dust, humidity, vibration, energy fluctuations) where standard computers cannot be fully qualified. For this reason, an industrial computer should be chosen instead of a normal computer, especially in production environments.</p>\n<p>\n	The following principles should be taken into account in the selection of computers for the production areas of industrial computers.</p>\n<h2>\n	Physical Durability</h2>\n<p>\n	<strong>Temperature:</strong> While normal computers are resistant to 35 &deg; C, industrial computers can operate in environments with ambient temperatures up to 45-50 &deg; C.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Liquid / Dust Protection: </strong>For panel PCs, IP66 or at least IP65 protection class should be provided on the outer front surface, and IP21 protection class should be provided for PCs to be used inside box type panels.</p>\n<p>\n	Some models of industrial computers are fanless, some are provided with cooling fans, which are provided with dust protection, with special filters mounted on the casing externally, usually to keep dust and other similar dirt. Dust protection is at a higher level than standard computers, especially thanks to protection classes such as IP65 - IP66.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Memory Units: </strong>Magnetic media (floppy disk, hard disk, CDROM), cooling system components directly and power supply</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Shock Impact / Vibration Protection: </strong>Disk drives are mounted with shock absorbers providing cushioning and mechanical insulation.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Humidity: </strong>Liquid contaminants / coolants frequently used in production and machine environments (sanding machines, machining centers, transfer lines, lathes etc.) negatively affect the computer in the facility. You can reach high relative humidity values with the industrial PC.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Supply Unit: </strong>Peak, fluctuating, transient voltages and noise generated by AC power supplies are very common in factory environments. The power supply of computers must be provided under all conditions and always with clean, non-variable DC voltages.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Electromagnetic Compatibility: </strong>Proper grounding, protective and proper insulation and electrical design must be provided in accordance with internationally accepted electrical standards.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Expandability and longevity: </strong>An IPC configuration provides different usage areas compared to the standard PC configuration with the expandable slots it provides. In addition, since they are more durable (for example, varnished motherboards, vibration-proof memory units, SSD (Solid State disks) using MLC (Multi Layer Cell) technology), they have a long working life.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Certifications: </strong>Industrial computers must offer certifications in addition to CE certification, which guarantees that they will be less affected by electrical noise in the environment.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	<strong>Test Reports: </strong>The most important document proving that a computer is industrial is the test reports to be submitted by the manufacturer. Each manufacturer must test its product for heat, vibration, aging, water and dust resistance. It should also be able to present to the customer when requested.</p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-left: 0.6pt;\">\n	Processor</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">\n	When purchasing an industrial computer, criteria such as the strongest and fastest processor and the highest RAM are demanded when purchasing a normal computer. Because the aim is to ensure that it is suitable for the software that will be updated over time. Therefore, users do not hesitate to strain their budgets while purchasing a computer. However, the vast majority of industrial computers do not see updates after they start to work at the point of application and are not used in different areas. For this reason, when choosing an industrial computer, not the top model processor, but a &quot;sufficient&quot; level processor should be selected.</p>\n<p>\n	Today, industrial PCs are widely used in many areas, from industrial automation to data collection, from transportation to defense, from kiosks to markets. The development of industrial computers also shows the progress in science and technology. In the future, the industrial market will continue to evolve with increasing expectations.

Applications of embedded computers can range from Industrial Automation, Digital Signage, Self-autonomous Vehicles, to Space Exploration, and more.</p>\n<p>\n	Typically <a href=\"https://refine-tr.com/en/lanner-products/embedded-box-pcs\"><strong>embedded computers</strong></a> are hardened devices as their use cases tend to be mostly in challenging harsh environment conditions, such as extreme temperature, vibration, shock, dust and humidity.</p>\n<p>\n	There are various types of embedded computers, from rugged industrial box PCs to panel PCs, mini PCs, industrial rackmount server, vehicle computers, and IoT gateways.</p>\n<p>\n	The main differences between an embedded and a desktop computer are purpose and design. Embedded computers are purposeful and dedicated equipment built from scratch to perform a specific task. It can run at maximum, with low resources, and withstand harsh conditions &mdash; something not possible with the consumer-grade computers.</p>\n<p>\n	Another crucial distinction is that the general-purpose desktops come with traditional motherboards, which allow you to expand or replace its components. Embedded computers, on the other hand, have all of its components burned-in in a single Printed Circuit Board (PCB) or Motherboard.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Among the many benefits of Embedded Box PCs are;</strong></p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Small Form Factor:</strong>&nbsp;One of the standout features of nearly all embedded computers is their size. Often built around small form factor motherboards like Mini-ITX&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.onlogic.com/computers/nuc/\" target=\"_blank\">I</a>ntel&#39;s NUC, embedded computers can be installed in places where antiquated towers would never fit. Solid state storage and flexible mounting options also allow embedded PCs to be utilized in virtually any position or orientation.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> In many instances embedded computers, as their name suggests, live deep inside complex systems, making reliability incredibly important. Industrial computers are engineered to provide 24 hour, uninterrupted operation, often employing carefully engineered, fanless and ventless enclosures designed to efficiently dissipate heat while protecting internal components from environmental damage ranging from dust and airborne debris to extreme temperatures, moisture and vibration.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Highly Reliable:</strong> Some embedded computers are designed for high reliability in critical mission-based applications like industrial or military deployments. They need to operate 24&times;7 in demanding applications and extreme environments like rugged terrains, continuous vibration, high temperatures, etc. These embedded computers can operate at a wide range of temperatures (e.g. -30&deg;C to 70&deg;C), dust-proof, and with protection from humidity.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Power Efficiency:</strong> Some applications require that embedded computers remain operational, day and night. That is why these computers are designed for power efficiency. Embedded computers come with lightweight and dedicated software so they do not need lots of processing power. Another advantage of power consumption is that some embedded computers come without fans and don&rsquo;t have any moving components.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>There are also various types of Embedded Box PC which are;</strong></p>\n<p>\n	<strong>The Rugged Industrial Box PC: </strong>The Rugged Industrial Box is excellent for applications that require processing power in harsh environment conditions.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>The Panel PC: </strong>The Panel PC comes with an integrated display screen that allows interface with the computer and to resist shock and toxic chemicals.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>The Mini PC:</strong> The mini-PC, although it is not compute-intensive, it can bring some intelligence to rough small and confined spaces.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>The Industrial Rackmount Server: </strong>Opposite to the mini-pc, the Industrial Rackmount can be used as a high intensive-compute and racked on top of other servers, without the need of A/C or optimal environments</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>The Vehicle Computer: </strong>The in-vehicle computer comes with wireless communication and vibrant-resistant capabilities to be used in first emergency-response vehicles, or similar applications.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>The IoT Gateway: </strong>The IoT gateway is a type of embedded computer that can act as a bridge between different technologies. It accepts inputs from IoT sensors or video cameras, processes the data, and can output to a display, actuator, or the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n	The way computers operate within the industry is not the same as how they are used at home or at the office.

In the modern world, vehicles owe their smooth operation to more than 50 microprocessor in-vehicle computers. On-board computers help drivers in a wide range of tasks, from securing the vehicle to saving fuel, from navigation to assisted braking, and make driving fun. This new technology has also saved many lives when it comes to accidents. Vehicles today are rapidly turning into a computer on wheels.</p>\n<p>\n	So what are all these computers in vehicles actually doing? It is possible to divide their aims into a few simple categories.</p>\n<h2>\n	Vehicle Computers</h2>\n<h3>\n	<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Advanced Diagnostics</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	The biggest benefits of the large number of sensors and microprocessors in your vehicle are that it is now very easy to determine the causes of problems your vehicle is experiencing. Sensors are used to observe and detect a wide range of different systems, including fuel / air mixture, sparks and much more. When one of these sensors detects any problems, it usually causes an dashboard light, such as a check engine light, to come on.</p>\n<h3>\n	<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Entertainment</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	In vehiche computers used in many vehicle entertainment and information systems such as GPS, video games, TVs, Internet radio and bluetooth compatibility. In-vehicle computers are very convenient, for example, to keep children busy or to create a hands-free environment while using your phone or music player, ensuring a safe ride. Today&#39;s on-board computers offer much more than a ride for everyone and also act as a source of entertainment.</p>\n<h3>\n	<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Safety </strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	The use of computers in vehicles has made transportation much safer than before. Airbags, assisted braking, rear view cameras and more are activated by computer sensors that detect problems in the smallest fraction of a second. This is why airbags can be deployed faster than the actual event of the collision.</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong>ABS</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-left:17.4pt;\">\n	Automatic braking systems (ABS) are a standard feature on most modern cars. If you don&rsquo;t respond to a sudden braking situation fast enough your ABS works to help you avoid a crash, and reduce the severity of a crash. The system essentially works to have the car&rsquo;s computer take over and brake for the driver.</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong>Backup Cameras</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-left:17.4pt;\">\n	Backup cameras are becoming more and more commonplace in the cars on the road. These backup cameras can provide aid to the driver when getting in and out of parking spaces and driveways. These cameras are designed to help drivers avoid backup collisions.</p>\n<h3>\n	<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Emission Controls</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	Another great benefit of in-car computers is that they help reduce pollution. Automakers are using in-car computers to ensure less smoke generation, which saves drivers time and money while also helping to protect the environment. On-board computers ensure that regulations for emission and fuel efficiency standards are properly met.</p>\n<p>\n	Before the emission laws were passed, it was possible to build a car without a computer. But now, due to the new laws, all vehicles have at least one computer system called ECM. This system is responsible for monitoring engine emissions and adjusting the vehicle engine to keep emission levels low. This system receives the following information from different sensors in the vehicle;</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Oxygen Sensor</li>\n	<li>\n		Air Pressure Sensor</li>\n	<li>\n		Air Temperature Sensor</li>\n	<li>\n		Engine Temperature Sensor</li>\n	<li>\n		Throttle Position Sensor</li>\n	<li>\n		Knock Sensor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	Using information from these different sensors, the on-board computer organizes different systems such as fuel injectors, spark plugs, idle speed, and more. Thanks to these regulations, your vehicle can keep emissions as low as possible.</p>\n<p>\n	It can be said that the automotive industry is experiencing one of the biggest periods of change. There are an increasing number of computers inside vehicles to power new technology, and this trend does not seem to be slowing down.</p>\n<p>\n	It would not be wrong to say that modern vehicles, especially high-quality, luxury vehicles and cars with more features for driver comfort and convenience have now become massive computer systems that drive on wheels. The more comfort you want to have in your car, the more computer technology you need to use.</p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"https://refine-tr.com\">https://refine-tr.com</a></p>\n<p>\n	Lanner Electronics: <a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'The first computers began to be used in automobiles in the 1970s to perform basic functions such as gearbox shifting and ignition timing.', NULL),

It accepts inputs from IoT sensors or video cameras, processes the data, and can output to a display, actuator, or the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n	The way computers operate within the industry is not the same as how they are used at home or at the office. The industry has different requirements and standards that demand another kind of computer.</p>\n<p>\n	The embedded computers are designed with the application in mind. They are being used in unimaginable applications within the industry that seemed impossible a few years ago. They are often designed to operate 24&times;7 at low energy levels in rough environments and tiny spaces.</p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"https://refine-tr.com\">https://refine-tr.com</a></p>\n<p>\n	Lanner Electronics: <a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'Embedded computer systems go by many names (Box PC, Gateway, Controller, Industrial PC, etc), but an Embedded PC is essentially any specialized computer system that is implemented as part of a larger device, intelligent system or installation.', NULL),

Security should be evaluated and implemented in terms of all devices operating on a network. In addition, it is very important to ensure that security is uninterrupted.</p>\n<p>\n	There are a few <strong>network security</strong> tools and techniques designed to help you do just that:</p>\n<h2>\n	How To Ensure Network Security?</h2>\n<h3>\n	Ensuring Physical Security</h3>\n<p>\n	If an intruder can physically access the host device, they can easily take control of the device. Particular attention should be paid to this issue and necessary precautions should be taken. Some physical security methods that can be taken are;</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Devices should only be kept in rooms or lockers (cabinets) that the administrator has the authority to open.</li>\n	<li>\n		It is wise to keep the names of those who have physically accessed the device in a list showing the access times.</li>\n	<li>\n		Cables should be labeled and what they are doing should be determined. Unused cables must be removed from the network.</li>\n	<li>\n		Access information to the device should not be kept in public.</li>\n	<li>\n		Power sources should be located and locked out of sight. Thus, the intruder should be prevented from cutting power.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n	Password Management</h3>\n<p>\n	The most effective way of password management is to use an approval mechanism system using &quot;LDAP&quot; or &quot;RADIUS&quot; authentication servers. Even if such a mechanism is used, a locally defined password must be available in the configuration file for the use of authorized rights. Most of the manageable devices have two different usage options called user accounts and administrator accounts. While users can only examine the interfaces and work, administrators have the right to make changes to the device settings. While keeping a password in configuration files, it is absolutely necessary to keep it encrypted. In addition, when determining a password, care should be taken that a good password does not have the properties. An effective password;</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Contains uppercase and lowercase letters.</li>\n	<li>\n		Includes punctuation and numbers.</li>\n	<li>\n		Can be easily remembered so it doesn&rsquo;t need to be written down.</li>\n	<li>\n		At least eight characters long.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n	Anti-malware software</h3>\n<p>\n	Malware such as viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, and keyloggers are designed to spread across computer systems and infect networks. The way to protect yourself from this software is through network security software designed to recognize dangerous programs and prevent them from spreading. Anti-malware and antivirus software can try to prevent malware from infecting the system, thereby minimizing the damage to the network.</p>\n<h3>\n	Firewalls</h3>\n<p>\n	Firewalls function much like gates that can be used to secure the borders between your network and the internet. Firewalls are used to manage network traffic, allowing authorized traffic through while blocking access to non-authorized traffic. Firewall software / devices are the building blocks of security and work in harmony with other security software / devices in the system and form the basis for future security technologies. Although firewall software is absolutely essential, it is not enough for security alone.</p>\n<h3>\n	Virtual private network (VPN)</h3>\n<p>\n	VPN tools are used to authenticate communication between secure networks and an endpoint device. Remote-access VPNs generally use IPsec or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for authentication, creating an encrypted line to block other parties from eavesdropping. Thanks to VPN, it is possible to both reduce our costs and move PCs and LANs in different places, which we could not do before because they were not safe and expensive, to the same platforms over the internet. In this way, it is possible for us to connect to our company while at home, access company resources, check our e-mails, and use the Intranet as if we were there.</p>\n<h3>\n	Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</h3>\n<p>\n	Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a software solution that aggregates and analyzes activity from many different resources across your entire IT infrastructure. SIEM collects security data from network devices, servers, domain controllers, and more. SIEM stores, normalizes, aggregates, and applies analytics to that data to discover trends, detect threats, and enable organizations to investigate any alerts. Basically, SIEM is a data aggregator, search, and reporting system. SIEM gathers immense amounts of data from your entire networked environment, consolidates and makes that data human accessible. With the data categorized and laid out at your fingertips, you can research data security breaches with as much detail as needed.</p>\n<h3>\n	IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)</h3>\n<p>\n	Intrusion Detection Systems have become one of the most important issues that are needed as a result of attacks on personal or legal pages, especially with the increase of web traffic used all over the world and the popularization of web pages in the development process of the Internet world. In addition, the possibility that the servers such as mail, dns, database, which are owned by institutions or organizations and kept open to the whole world, may be exposed to similar attacks has made Intrusion Detection Systems an indispensable part of the Internet Security field. IDS&#39;s can keep a record of the traffic they listen to and, when necessary, generate reports based on these records. When they detect an attack, they can prevent attacks, notify their administrators by e-mail or similar means, run a pre-created program, and record telnet-like connections and monitor them afterwards. With all these features, IDSs help the system to operate safely and help System Administrators monitor the System strongly.</p>\n<p>\n	It is obvious that today cyber threats are more than ever in terms of both number and complexity, and therefore networks are very vulnerable to attacks that can cause great harm. However, if proactive measures are taken and the above mentioned methods are applied, network security can be achieved to a great extent.</p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"https://refine-tr.com/\">https://refine-tr.com/</a></p>\n<p>\n	Lanner Electronics: <a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'Network Security as the preventative measures taken to safeguard network infrastructure from unauthorized access, modification, malfunction, misuse, improper disclosure or destruction of data.', NULL),

The industrial revolution brought about four revolutions after this process.</p>\n<p>\n	In the 1970&rsquo;s, in the industrial sector, where different methods were discussed, the age of automation became indispensable for production tools for forty years. During this period, mechanics and electronics merged under a single name. The hybrid model of mechanics and electricity has revealed a new technology, automation. Automation has left its place to digitalization and robot technologies with mechanical and electronic models. The automation revolution, which lasted about forty years, reached a different point with the arrival of the internet in the early 2000s. With the introduction of the Internet, the 4.0 industrial age has begun.</p>\n<h2>\n	Industry 4.0 Innovation In Technology</h2>\n<p>\n	The most common question these days is &quot;What is Industry 4.0?&quot; The beginning of the 4.0 era continued with the widespread use of the internet in production. The technology developing in the age of 4.0 has enabled new developments to occur in the production era with smart machines, advanced operating systems and artificial intelligence. These developments, as in every period, developed the industry sector the most. Artificial intelligence has been one of the most important tools of this forward leap in the industry. With artificial intelligence, technical experience, speed and efficiency, and smart machines, production increased exponentially, and new sectors and markets were opened.</p>\n<p>\n	With the 4.0 revolution, factories have reached high production capacities with less fuel, labor and energy. This leap in production attracted the attention of manufacturers. Businesses that benefited greatly from time, energy and profit with 4.0 increased their annual turnover to the same extent. This situation led to the growth of businesses and enabled them to have a say in the world market.</p>\n<h2>\n	What Does Industry 4.0 Aim For?</h2>\n<p>\n	What is aimed with <strong>Industry 4.0</strong> is to maximize production capability. It is aimed to shorten the time between supply and demand and to enable consumers to reach the products more easily. Industrial companies working with consumer index in high production aim to get rid of the environment and the world from some unnecessary factors.</p>\n<h2>\n	Experiences With Industry 4.0?</h2>\n<p>\n	Environmentally friendly production lines with a sufficient number of qualified work force began to be preferred. This savings realized in many areas ensured that a significant amount of money was not lost during the production phase. As money was saved during production, important developments were experienced in many areas such as social welfare level and income equality.</p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"https://refine-tr.com/\">https://refine-tr.com/</a></p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Lanner Electronics</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'The definition of Industry 4.0 was answered with a technology fair held in Germany in 2011.

To do this, it opens an encrypted tunnel to the other network. This transferred information is shared mutually through the tunnel. This stream is a fully encrypted stream. Therefore, it cannot be viewed from the outside. In this way, the traffic flow takes place in the specified country. For example you can log in to the sites according to Canadian rules and procedures on the network trip, if you choose Canada. VPN software or mobile apps create a network drive system for you to access this private tunnel. Acting as a virtual network adapter, this software also forwards an IP address from the network you want to connect to. The IP address, in a way, creates the identity of your connection.

Therefore, single-cable lines are no longer sufficient for backup connection and redundancy. In a traditional approach, adding a new wired connection to a fixed location or via a different entry can result in the risks of disconnection during construction/maintenance and high installation costs. Wireless failover connectivity is a more effective and economical solution as it provides consistency and diversity by providing a physically uninterrupted connection. In addition, SD-WAN provides reliability by managing required access for system diagnostics and update/patch. Lanner&#39;s NCR-1510 and endpoints have the ability to enable Out-of-Band Management (OOBM), reducing the need for an onsite IT team. With a direct connection from the console port of an LTE adapter to the primary router at a branch location, network administrators can troubleshoot problems remotely. In this way, it has the advantage of solving problems in a timely manner. Network Bandwidth is also guaranteed during network failover with Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) technologies; through bandwidth aggregation and traffic segmentation between wired and wireless WAN links, SD-WAN allows IT to set configurations that ensure critical data comes before the wireless failover link.

Their way of usage and complexibility , on the other hand, differs from one country to another. It is essential that logistics companies from all over the world understand the advantages of ITS offer so taht they can evaluate the potential advantages, relevant costs, abd how to implement ITS ideally.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>ITS </strong>is an improved system for shortening traveling times and increasing traffic safety, optimum use of available road capacity and mobility. Thus, this system serves useful purposes as decreasing the damages to environment and contributing to energy efficiency. So what samples can be given as Intelligent Transportation System?</p>\n<h2>\n	Intelligent Transportation System Samples</h2>\n<p>\n	<strong>ITS</strong>, is a system that enhances transportation quality or achieves other results based on applications which monitor, manage or improve transportation system. Majorly, ITS is based on collecting data and analyzing the collected data. After the system successfully collects data and analyzes it, the outcomes will be used for planning, managing and controlling transportation system. Additionally; we have listed some samples of ITS.</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		&nbsp;ITS used in Glasgow, Scotland shares regular information about bus services, seat availability, current location, next station, and departure time.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		The government of Seoul designed the routes of night bus services based on the analysis of mobile phone location data. The Seoul Government has worked with a private telecommunication company to analyze calls made from 12.00 a.m. to 5.00 a.m. By matching this data with billing addresses collectively, the Government determined which regions show more demand for night bus services.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		New Orleans City specified the waiting locations of ambulances based on emergency call models.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Sydney Subway, the biggest mass transportation project in Australia, can nearly double the city&rsquo;s current public transportation capacity. Also, one of the main features of this project is that it will have a driverless system.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		The Cityringen Project located in Copenhagen will create a new circular line in the city centre. This driverless, automatic libe guarantees the access of 240.000 passengers per day, and the access mentioned will provide a 24-hour transportation system to Copenhagen citizens.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n	Benefits of Intelligent Transportation System</h2>\n<p>\n	<strong>We may list lots of benefits for ITS</strong>;</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Determines insufficient roads</li>\n	<li>\n		Decreases accident rates</li>\n	<li>\n		Perform analysis for new road constructions</li>\n	<li>\n		Aims to give more efficiency to transportation system with the use of information, communication and control technologies</li>\n	<li>\n		Increases the attractiveness of public transportation</li>\n	<li>\n		Decreases traveling time and industrial costs</li>\n	<li>\n		Helps reducing the negative environmental effects of public transportation</li>\n	<li>\n		Supports speed control system and reformations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<strong>ITS </strong>provides beneficial services such as public transports for passengers, time tables, and enhanced security in vehicles and terminals.

So what are requirements to ensure <strong>5G hardware security</strong>?</p>\n<h2>\n	Things to Do to Ensure 5G Network Security</h2>\n<p>\n	In 5G technology, perimeter-based security controls such as a basic firewall or data encryption are not acceptable to ensure network security. In addition, service providers use IntelR embedded hardware security features to reduce cybersecurity risks and increase overall productivity and usability. Three main areas of protection are required for effective 5G hardware. They are as follows:</p>\n<h2>\n	Key Management Security</h2>\n<p>\n	Keys are highly effective for providing network, workload security, authentication, and encryption. Strong authentication requires private security keys and digital key management protection.</p>\n<h2>\n	Crypto Boost</h2>\n<p>\n	Crypto acceleration provides cryptographic functions in hardware rather than software. That helps to maximize the processing of encrypted network traffic. In addition, network security improves processing performance.</p>\n<h2>\n	Platform Firmware Durability</h2>\n<p>\n	Each platform should have main firmware components for booting and operating requirements. Platform firmware must be original and have reliable connectivity for the entire platform. Then it can handle critical software operations and protect against highly sensitive data intrusion like malware, spyware, ransomware, and data leakage. At the same time, service providers can develop the potential of 5G technology by securing these areas above. Moreover, service providers are critical to benefit from emerging trends such as confidential computing and gain new service opportunities.</p>\n<h2>\n	5G Network Security Components</h2>\n<p>\n	A useful 5G network security needs to be built on solid foundations.

In short, WEB 3.0 is a fully blockchain-supported and personalized version of the internet. The internet system used today is WEB 2.0. In this system, data is controlled by central powers. With WEB 2.0, we can access information on social media platforms as long as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter allow it. In short, they can disable your account or take the control of your account from you.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>WEB 3.0</strong> is defined as a new generation of internet technology based on the benefit of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). It also aims to create intelligent websites and web applications. Web 3.0 is based on artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning techniques to deliver more personalized and relevant information. Big data analytics is even more open to development with its intelligent search algorithm. In addition, some of the companies that develop products suitable for <strong>WEB 3.0 applications</strong> are Amazon, Apple, and Google. The applications with WEB 3.0 technologies are Siri and Wolfram Alpha.</p>\n<h2>\n	What awaits us in the future of the internet?</h2>\n<p>\n	WEB 3.0 is an innovation suitable for our digitalizing age. The many benefits that this technology will offer in the future are as follows:</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>No central control point</strong></p>\n<p>\n	Since there will be no intermediaries, they cannot control user data either. That also helps reduce the risk of censorship by governments or companies. It also allows for a decrease in the effectiveness of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Increased information connectivity</strong></p>\n<p>\n	As product sales increase on the internet, larger data sets offer more algorithms with analysis. That is essential in providing accurate information that meets the specific needs of individual users.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>More efficient analysis</strong></p>\n<p>\n	With the developing technology, analysis processes have also become more efficient. In addition, more intelligent algorithms are filtered by artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Advertising and marketing</strong></p>\n<p>\n	Constant encounters with online and irrelevant advertisements are uninteresting to many people. These ads are valid if they relate to the person&#39;s interests and needs. In addition, WEB 3.0 leverages more intelligent AI systems and aims to improve targeted advertising based on consumer data.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Advanced customer support</strong></p>\n<p>\n	When it comes to websites and web applications, customer service is significant concerning user experience. In addition, it will be practical to use intelligent chatbots that can talk to multiple customers. Thus, users can get a superior customer experience when working with customer representatives.</p>\n<p>\n	As <strong>Refine</strong>, we supply products of <strong>Lanner Electronics Inc.</strong> which is a world leading provider of advanced network devices, embedded computers, virtual platforms, durable industrial hardware design.

Direct computing to the vCPE (network edge), where data is created and consumed, is critical to exploit opportunities and operational savings. vCPE is needed as much as uCPE. So&nbsp;<strong>what are vCPE and uCPE</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>what is SD-WAN vCPE,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>what is whitebox routing?</strong></p>\n<p>\n	What are vCPE and uCPE? The vCPE resides inside your network just outside the network hub. This edge is based on locations, such as regional data centers, next-generation central offices (NGCOs), hard-wired access points, wireless access base stations, and radio access networks (RANs). If you would like to find out the answer for the following questions: what is vCPE, why is it used, what is uCPE, why is it used, and what are the differences between uCPE and vCPE?; Continue reading our article to learn about vCPE and uCPE.</p>\n<h2>\n	What is vCPE? Why is it used?</h2>\n<p>\n	Migrating computing to vCPE allows for effective routing of workload placement. In addition, it has many advantages. These are as follows:</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>High speed</strong></p>\n<p>\n	Moving data processing and analysis to vCPE helps improving system responsiveness. That makes transactions happen faster.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Advanced network traffic management</strong></p>\n<p>\n	By reducing the amount of data sent over the network to the cloud, large amounts of data are transferred with bandwidth.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Advanced security features</strong></p>\n<p>\n	With a correctly implemented edge computing solution, it may be possible to increase data security by limiting the transferred data over.</p>\n<h2>\n	What is uCPE? Why is it used?</h2>\n<p>\n	In general, the questions about what is uCPE and vCPE are the same. After the vCPE mentioned above, uCPE consists of Software Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) running on a standard operating system hosted on an open server. A successful uCPE deployment supports a multi-vendor, multi-component architecture. That&#39;s why uCPE brings the power of the cloud to the telecommunications network. In addition, the reason for using uCPE is that it has several benefits. These benefits are as follows:</p>\n<p>\n	&bull; Segregation of network devices into hardware and software components from multiple vendors</p>\n<p>\n	&bull; Using out-of-the-box (COTS) servers to break cost curves</p>\n<p>\n	&bull; Using a mix of open source and commercial software components</p>\n<p>\n	&bull; Collaboration with customers and suppliers</p>\n<p>\n	The next topic is what SD-WAN vCPE is. It leverages the power of software to manage connectivity and services between software-defined data centres. In addition, remote connections and connectivity between cloud systems simplify administration and service management. In this case, the existing router structure is used during the application process. Furthermore, virtual customer facility equipment (vCPE) is also among the choices.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>What are the differences between uCPE and vCPE?</strong></p>\n<p>\n	uCPE is an advanced version of vCPE that solves some of its limitations. It is also based on software and VNFs. Besides that, virtualization is performed by the branches themselves. For this, Lanner has a recommendation for hardware suitable to run multiple Virtual Network Functions (VNF).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>NCA-1516</strong></p>\n<p>\n	The NCA-1516, a desktop network device powered by the C3000, is capable of both mmWave 5G and Sub-6GHz 5G. Besides, its WiFi6 is compatible with both 2.4G and 5G. The NCA-1516 is enhanced with extensive networking features and configurations for vCPE/uCPE and edge security.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>NCA-2513</strong></p>\n<p>\n	Designed with the C3758, C3558, C3558R or C3338R CPU, the NCA-2513 offers a higher TDP and higher frequency with the ability to handle up to 8 cores. Also, includes Intel&reg; QAT, 8x Ethernet ports, 64GB system memory, two dual Gen3 bypass (with SKU), 1x NIC module slot, 1x M.2, 1x PCIe x8 or x4 FH/HL (with SKU), and compatibility.</p>\n<p>\n	As <strong>Refine</strong>, we supply products of <strong>Lanner Electronics Inc.</strong> which is a world leading provider of advanced network devices, embedded computers, virtual platforms, durable industrial hardware design.

That&#39;s why <strong>5G hardware components</strong> must have an edge-to-core framework that offers the possible attack surface.</p>\n<p>\n	An ideal 5G network security protection should address security at every layer, protecting all systems from every sensor node to the cloud. Embedded security ICs provide features; such as advanced physical security layers, cryptographic algorithms, secure boot, encryption, secure key storage, digital signature creation, and verification. So what are requirements to ensure <strong>5G hardware security</strong>?</p>\n<h2>\n	Things to Do to Ensure 5G Network Security</h2>\n<p>\n	In 5G technology, perimeter-based security controls such as a basic firewall or data encryption are not acceptable to ensure network security. In addition, service providers use IntelR embedded hardware security features to reduce cybersecurity risks and increase overall productivity and usability. Three main areas of protection are required for effective 5G hardware. They are as follows:</p>\n<h2>\n	Key Management Security</h2>\n<p>\n	Keys are highly effective for providing network, workload security, authentication, and encryption. Strong authentication requires private security keys and digital key management protection.</p>\n<h2>\n	Crypto Boost</h2>\n<p>\n	Crypto acceleration provides cryptographic functions in hardware rather than software. That helps to maximize the processing of encrypted network traffic. In addition, network security improves processing performance.</p>\n<h2>\n	Platform Firmware Durability</h2>\n<p>\n	Each platform should have main firmware components for booting and operating requirements. Platform firmware must be original and have reliable connectivity for the entire platform. Then it can handle critical software operations and protect against highly sensitive data intrusion like malware, spyware, ransomware, and data leakage. At the same time, service providers can develop the potential of 5G technology by securing these areas above. Moreover, service providers are critical to benefit from emerging trends such as confidential computing and gain new service opportunities.</p>\n<h2>\n	5G Network Security Components</h2>\n<p>\n	A useful 5G network security needs to be built on solid foundations. For this, Lanner network devices provided by Refine Inc offer many solutions.

This increasing demand causes the need for bandwidth. <strong>Wifi 6E</strong> is being developed to meet this need. A new technology, Wifi 6E, is among the technologies that is going to be more and more popular in the future. In addition, 6E offers the necessary infrastructure to prevent many devices from having problems connecting to the internet. So, what do you need to know about the 6E? If you are interested, please continue reading our article for more information on what is <strong>wifi 6E</strong>, what it does, coverage, and router.</p>\n<h2>\n	What is Wifi 6E?</h2>\n<p>\n	<strong>Wifi 6E</strong> is a <strong>technology </strong>that can operate in the 6 GHz band. In addition, the 6E has technology that allows 14 additional 80 MHz channels and 7 additional 160 MHz channels. These channels do not overlap with each other. Also, it helps to reduce congestion in areas and regions where many networks operate.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Wifi 6E</strong> has the same features as the 802.11ax (Wifi 6 standard) infrastructure. Besides, there is a difference between these two technologies. In short, the 6E only exchanges data on the 6 GHz frequency. So, what does 6E do?</p>\n<h2>\n	What Does Wifi 6E Do?</h2>\n<p>\n	The Federal Communications Board (FCC) has announced the availability of the 6 GHz band for 6E. The use of the 6 GHz band allows access to higher speeds than the existing wifi 6. It is necessary to have a 6E compatible device to benefit from this connection speed.</p>\n<p>\n	This technology, which offers 6 GHz frequency, provides its users with higher efficiency than standard WLANs. Wifi 6E technology was developed for use in public areas. In addition, with the iFi6E 6 GHz frequency, users can output a large amount of data. As well as, the scope of wireless internet has been expanded.</p>\n<p>\n	With the <strong>6E technology</strong> offered to users, the image quality of 4K and 8K resolution videos and virtual reality applications has increased. For this reason, 6E technology is primarily preferred by public institutions and organizations. The 6E technology will be offered to standard users through public institutions.</p>\n<h2>\n	Wifi 6E Router&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>\n	Wifi 6E routers are devices used to create next-generation routers. These appliances have been developed to take advantage of 6E technology. Due to the development of this technology, there are limited compatible device options.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Wifi 6E technology</strong> is developed on wifi 6 technology, but it is a more advanced version. In addition, the 6E stands out in crowded areas where broadcast waves are intense. It is stated that the average speed of public network users used in a crowded environment will increase at least four times with Wifi 6E.</p>\n<h2>\n	Wifi 6E Coverage</h2>\n<p>\n	<strong>Wifi 6E</strong> has many advantages, and its coverage area is a technology product. The 6E is fast and powerful as well as wide-ranging. With this technology, you can enable a large numeral of devices to connect to your network. In addition, 6E has a more vital security protocol so you can establish a more secure connection. Also, 6E technology ensures efficient use of bandwidth. Being a fast technological product, it shows high performance.</p>\n<p>\n	With this technology, communication between devices is provided via a router. It means that the device does not always keep the antenna on to send and receive signals. Therefore, it consumes less battery and has longer battery life. Wifi 6E is a technology that eliminates the difference between a wired connection and a wireless connection.</p>\n<p>\n	Because of the high-frequency 6GHz band for gigabit performance the new 6E speed is granted. Wavelengths in the higher frequency bands cover shorter distances. That means that the coverage will not extend to the 2.4 GHz band.</p>\n<p>\n	As Refine, we supply products of Lanner Electronics Inc. which is a world leading provider of advanced network devices, embedded computers, virtual platforms, durable industrial hardware design.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"https://refine-tr.com/\">https://refine-tr.com/</a></p>\n<p>\n	Lanner Electronics:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com/\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'The need for the internet is increasing with new applications, games, and videos.

What Does It Do?', 3, 'blog/what-is-poe-lanner.jpg', '', '<p>PoE (Power over Ethernet) stands for electricity over the Ethernet protocol. So&nbsp;<strong>what is PoE</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>what does PoE do</strong>?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You do not need to connect power cables to many types of PoE-supported network devices such as VoIP phones and IP cameras. In addition, it is possible to provide electrical support to PoE-supported devices with cat5 or cat6 cable. This solution is applied in various ways. Increasing amounts of new PoE devices are produced day by day. In addition, many devices take advantage of PoE technology or are developed by it. If you are interested in what PoE does, where it is it used, and why it is preferred, please continue reading our article to find out what is PoE and its uses.</p>\n\n<h2>What is PoE? What are the Usage Areas?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>PoE technology</strong> complies with the IEEE 802.3af and 802.3at standards set by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. This technology manages how network equipment should work to ensure interoperability between devices. Devices with PoE capability are&nbsp; power supply equipment, powered devices, and sometimes both. In addition, a power-transmitting device is a power supply equipment, while the operating device is a powered device. Also, most power types of equipment are network switches or PoE injectors designed for use with non-PoE switches.</p>\n\n<p>Powered devices, VoIP phones, wireless access points, and IP cameras are examples. &ldquo;What is PoE, and what does PoE do?&rdquo; After these questions, the most frequently asked question is: &ldquo;What are the usage areas of PoE?&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>All network devices that transfer data following Power over Ethernet procedures and receive their feeding needs from the same Cat6 cable are converged on the relevant ports on the PoE switch. The PoE switch transfers the data traffic from these devices to the uplink. Thus, it provides access to the internet or intranet. An example of a device that provides electrical power is IP PoE cameras.</p>\n\n<p>Power over Ethernet (PoE) allows remote or external equipment to be installed without requiring you to connect to AC power. That helps to spread power over more areas without the need to install additional electrical infrastructure or power outlets at every endpoint. In addition, the equipment is supplied without the need for electrical flow. On the other hand, an Ethernet cable is less costly. PoE-based systems are also much more cost-effective, as they are usually installed in buildings.</p>\n\n<h2>Why PoE Preferred?</h2>\n\n<p>There are many reasons for choosing PoE. These are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Data transfer with a cable between the switcher and the device is possible with PoE.</li>\n	<li>The device does not require a separate power setup or connection.</li>\n	<li>It saves space and is very simple to install.</li>\n	<li>The remoteness of the electrical power source does not prevent the device from being positioned.</li>\n	<li>You can move target devices to any place with a LAN cable.</li>\n	<li>Even if there is a mains failure, the electrical power in the device is guaranteed.</li>\n	<li>It is also safe as there is no central voltage.</li>\n	<li>Devices can be shut down or rebooted remotely.</li>\n	<li>It needs simple configuration and management.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As <strong>Refine</strong>, we supply products of <strong>Lanner Electronics Inc.</strong> which is a world leading provider of advanced network devices, embedded computers, virtual platforms, durable industrial hardware design.</p>\n', 'PoE (Power over Ethernet) stands for electricity over the Ethernet protocol.

Direct computing to the vCPE (network edge), where data is created and consumed, is critical to exploit opportunities and operational savings. vCPE is needed as much as uCPE. So&nbsp;<strong>what are vCPE and uCPE</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>what is SD-WAN vCPE,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>what is whitebox routing?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What are vCPE and uCPE? The vCPE resides inside your network just outside the network hub. This edge is based on locations, such as regional data centers, next-generation central offices (NGCOs), hard-wired access points, wireless access base stations, and radio access networks (RANs). If you would like to find out the answer for the following questions: what is vCPE, why is it used, what is uCPE, why is it used, and what are the differences between uCPE and vCPE?; Continue reading our article to learn about vCPE and uCPE.</p>\n\n<h2>What is vCPE? Why is it used?</h2>\n\n<p>Migrating computing to vCPE allows for effective routing of workload placement. In addition, it has many advantages. These are as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong>High speed</strong></p>\n\n<p>Moving data processing and analysis to vCPE helps improving system responsiveness. That makes transactions happen faster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Advanced network traffic management</strong></p>\n\n<p>By reducing the amount of data sent over the network to the cloud, large amounts of data are transferred with bandwidth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Advanced security features</strong></p>\n\n<p>With a correctly implemented edge computing solution, it may be possible to increase data security by limiting the transferred data over.</p>\n\n<h2>What is uCPE? Why is it used?</h2>\n\n<p>In general, the questions about what is uCPE and vCPE are the same. After the vCPE mentioned above, uCPE consists of Software Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) running on a standard operating system hosted on an open server. A successful uCPE deployment supports a multi-vendor, multi-component architecture. That&#39;s why uCPE brings the power of the cloud to the telecommunications network. In addition, the reason for using uCPE is that it has several benefits. These benefits are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>&bull; Segregation of network devices into hardware and software components from multiple vendors</p>\n\n<p>&bull; Using out-of-the-box (COTS) servers to break cost curves</p>\n\n<p>&bull; Using a mix of open source and commercial software components</p>\n\n<p>&bull; Collaboration with customers and suppliers</p>\n\n<p>The next topic is what SD-WAN vCPE is. It leverages the power of software to manage connectivity and services between software-defined data centres. In addition, remote connections and connectivity between cloud systems simplify administration and service management. In this case, the existing router structure is used during the application process. Furthermore, virtual customer facility equipment (vCPE) is also among the choices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the differences between uCPE and vCPE?</strong></p>\n\n<p>uCPE is an advanced version of vCPE that solves some of its limitations. It is also based on software and VNFs. Besides that, virtualization is performed by the branches themselves. For this, Lanner has a recommendation for hardware suitable to run multiple Virtual Network Functions (VNF).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>NCA-1516</strong></p>\n\n<p>The NCA-1516, a desktop network device powered by the C3000, is capable of both mmWave 5G and Sub-6GHz 5G. Besides, its WiFi6 is compatible with both 2.4G and 5G. The NCA-1516 is enhanced with extensive networking features and configurations for vCPE/uCPE and edge security.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NCA-2513</strong></p>\n\n<p>Designed with the C3758, C3558, C3558R or C3338R CPU, the NCA-2513 offers a higher TDP and higher frequency with the ability to handle up to 8 cores.

When it comes to the future of the Internet, WEB 3.0 comes to mind first. So&nbsp;<strong>what is WEB 3.0?</strong></p>\n\n<p>That concept is one of the significant innovations that have entered our lives recently. WEB 3.0 is a subject that you must learn to understand and adapt to the future aspects of the internet. In &nbsp;this article, we will share with you those who are curious about what WEB 3.0 is, which is seen as the future of the internet. Please continue to read our article to learn about &ldquo;what is WEB 3.0?&rdquo; which is considered to be the future.</p>\n\n<h2>What is Web 3.0? What features does Web 3.0 have?</h2>\n\n<p>This concept states that the internet can be used in a decentralized and Peer to Peer manner. In short, WEB 3.0 is a fully blockchain-supported and personalized version of the internet. The internet system used today is WEB 2.0. In this system, data is controlled by central powers. With WEB 2.0, we can access information on social media platforms as long as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter allow it. In short, they can disable your account or take the control of your account from you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WEB 3.0</strong> is defined as a new generation of internet technology based on the benefit of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). It also aims to create intelligent websites and web applications. Web 3.0 is based on artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning techniques to deliver more personalized and relevant information. Big data analytics is even more open to development with its intelligent search algorithm. In addition, some of the companies that develop products suitable for <strong>WEB 3.0 applications</strong> are Amazon, Apple, and Google. The applications with WEB 3.0 technologies are Siri and Wolfram Alpha.</p>\n\n<h2>What awaits us in the future of the internet?</h2>\n\n<p>WEB 3.0 is an innovation suitable for our digitalizing age. The many benefits that this technology will offer in the future are as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong>No central control point</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since there will be no intermediaries, they cannot control user data either. That also helps reduce the risk of censorship by governments or companies. It also allows for a decrease in the effectiveness of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Increased information connectivity</strong></p>\n\n<p>As product sales increase on the internet, larger data sets offer more algorithms with analysis. That is essential in providing accurate information that meets the specific needs of individual users.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More efficient analysis</strong></p>\n\n<p>With the developing technology, analysis processes have also become more efficient. In addition, more intelligent algorithms are filtered by artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Advertising and marketing</strong></p>\n\n<p>Constant encounters with online and irrelevant advertisements are uninteresting to many people. These ads are valid if they relate to the person&#39;s interests and needs. In addition, WEB 3.0 leverages more intelligent AI systems and aims to improve targeted advertising based on consumer data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Advanced customer support</strong></p>\n\n<p>When it comes to websites and web applications, customer service is significant concerning user experience. In addition, it will be practical to use intelligent chatbots that can talk to multiple customers. Thus, users can get a superior customer experience when working with customer representatives.</p>\n\n<p>As <strong>Refine</strong>, we supply products of <strong>Lanner Electronics Inc.</strong> which is a world leading provider of advanced network devices, embedded computers, virtual platforms, durable industrial hardware design.&nbsp;</p>\n', 'Among the most frequently asked questions about technology and the internet: \"What will the internet be like in the future?\".

That&#39;s why <strong>5G hardware components</strong> must have an edge-to-core framework that offers the possible attack surface.</p>\n\n<p>An ideal 5G network security protection should address security at every layer, protecting all systems from every sensor node to the cloud. Embedded security ICs provide features; such as advanced physical security layers, cryptographic algorithms, secure boot, encryption, secure key storage, digital signature creation, and verification. So what are requirements to ensure <strong>5G hardware security</strong>?</p>\n\n<h2>Things to Do to Ensure 5G Network Security</h2>\n\n<p>In 5G technology, perimeter-based security controls such as a basic firewall or data encryption are not acceptable to ensure network security. In addition, service providers use IntelR embedded hardware security features to reduce cybersecurity risks and increase overall productivity and usability. Three main areas of protection are required for effective 5G hardware. They are as follows:</p>\n\n<h2>Key Management Security</h2>\n\n<p>Keys are highly effective for providing network, workload security, authentication, and encryption. Strong authentication requires private security keys and digital key management protection.</p>\n\n<h2>Crypto Boost</h2>\n\n<p>Crypto acceleration provides cryptographic functions in hardware rather than software. That helps to maximize the processing of encrypted network traffic. In addition, network security improves processing performance.</p>\n\n<h2>Platform Firmware Durability</h2>\n\n<p>Each platform should have main firmware components for booting and operating requirements. Platform firmware must be original and have reliable connectivity for the entire platform. Then it can handle critical software operations and protect against highly sensitive data intrusion like malware, spyware, ransomware, and data leakage. At the same time, service providers can develop the potential of 5G technology by securing these areas above. Moreover, service providers are critical to benefit from emerging trends such as confidential computing and gain new service opportunities.</p>\n\n<h2>5G Network Security Components</h2>\n\n<p>A useful 5G network security needs to be built on solid foundations.

This increasing demand causes the need for bandwidth. <strong>Wifi 6E</strong> is being developed to meet this need. A new technology, Wifi 6E, is among the technologies that is going to be more and more popular in the future. In addition, 6E offers the necessary infrastructure to prevent many devices from having problems connecting to the internet. So, what do you need to know about the 6E? If you are interested, please continue reading our article for more information on what is <strong>wifi 6E</strong>, what it does, coverage, and router.</p>\n\n<h2>What is Wifi 6E?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Wifi 6E</strong> is a <strong>technology </strong>that can operate in the 6 GHz band. In addition, the 6E has technology that allows 14 additional 80 MHz channels and 7 additional 160 MHz channels. These channels do not overlap with each other. Also, it helps to reduce congestion in areas and regions where many networks operate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wifi 6E</strong> has the same features as the 802.11ax (Wifi 6 standard) infrastructure. Besides, there is a difference between these two technologies. In short, the 6E only exchanges data on the 6 GHz frequency. So, what does 6E do?</p>\n\n<h2>What Does Wifi 6E Do?</h2>\n\n<p>The Federal Communications Board (FCC) has announced the availability of the 6 GHz band for 6E. The use of the 6 GHz band allows access to higher speeds than the existing wifi 6. It is necessary to have a 6E compatible device to benefit from this connection speed.</p>\n\n<p>This technology, which offers 6 GHz frequency, provides its users with higher efficiency than standard WLANs. Wifi 6E technology was developed for use in public areas. In addition, with the iFi6E 6 GHz frequency, users can output a large amount of data. As well as, the scope of wireless internet has been expanded.</p>\n\n<p>With the <strong>6E technology</strong> offered to users, the image quality of 4K and 8K resolution videos and virtual reality applications has increased. For this reason, 6E technology is primarily preferred by public institutions and organizations. The 6E technology will be offered to standard users through public institutions.</p>\n\n<h2>Wifi 6E Router&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Wifi 6E routers are devices used to create next-generation routers. These appliances have been developed to take advantage of 6E technology. Due to the development of this technology, there are limited compatible device options.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wifi 6E technology</strong> is developed on wifi 6 technology, but it is a more advanced version. In addition, the 6E stands out in crowded areas where broadcast waves are intense. It is stated that the average speed of public network users used in a crowded environment will increase at least four times with Wifi 6E.</p>\n\n<h2>Wifi 6E Coverage</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Wifi 6E</strong> has many advantages, and its coverage area is a technology product. The 6E is fast and powerful as well as wide-ranging. With this technology, you can enable a large numeral of devices to connect to your network. In addition, 6E has a more vital security protocol so you can establish a more secure connection. Also, 6E technology ensures efficient use of bandwidth. Being a fast technological product, it shows high performance.</p>\n\n<p>With this technology, communication between devices is provided via a router. It means that the device does not always keep the antenna on to send and receive signals. Therefore, it consumes less battery and has longer battery life. Wifi 6E is a technology that eliminates the difference between a wired connection and a wireless connection.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the high-frequency 6GHz band for gigabit performance the new 6E speed is granted. Wavelengths in the higher frequency bands cover shorter distances. That means that the coverage will not extend to the 2.4 GHz band.</p>\n\n<p>As Refine, we supply products of Lanner Electronics Inc. which is a world leading provider of advanced network devices, embedded computers, virtual platforms, durable industrial hardware design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://refine-tr.com/\">https://refine-tr.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Lanner Electronics:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com/\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'The need for the internet is increasing with new applications, games, and videos.

This proximity to the source of the data can deliver real business benefits: faster insights, improved response times, and better bandwidth availability. So, what should you know about edge information systems? If you are interested, please continue reading our article for more information about the edge information.</p>\n\n<h2>What Is An Edge Computing Example?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Edge computing</strong> helps you unlock the potential of massive amounts of data generated and unused by connected devices. You can unlock new business opportunities, increase operational efficiency, and provide faster, more reliable, and consistent experiences for your customers. The best edge computing models can help you improve performance by analyzing data locally. A well-thought-out approach to edge computing can keep workloads up to date. It can also help protecting the privacy and complying with data residency laws and regulations according to predefined principles.&nbsp;An effective edge computing model must address network security risks, management complexities, latency, and bandwidth limitations. A suitable model should help you to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Manage your workloads across all clouds and any number of devices</li>\n	<li>Reliable and seamless deployment of applications across all edge locations</li>\n	<li>Maintaining openness and flexibility to adapt to evolving needs</li>\n	<li>Operate more confidently and with confidence</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Edge Computing</strong>; It is an IT system designed to bring applications and computing capability as close as possible to the users who need them. Edge computing is essential to address gaps in cloud-based applications and services in terms of performance and regulatory requirements. In other words, cloud computing cannot always meet the response time demands of critical applications. It may also be insufficient to meet the local storage needs of companies that are subject to legal regulations regarding where data is stored.</p>\n\n<p>The shortcomings of cloud computing pose a significant problem as the trend towards digitalization in improving efficiency, and business performance increase the demand for high-performance applications, especially Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Therefore, IoT applications are ideal candidates for the edge.</p>\n\n<h2>What Is Edge Computing Used For?&nbsp; &nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>There are several areas <strong>where edge computing is used</strong>. These fields are as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong>In retail</strong></p>\n\n<p>Edge computing can use sensors and cameras to improve retail inventory accuracy and make both supply chains and product development more efficient.

Therefore, single-cable lines are no longer sufficient for backup connection and redundancy. In a traditional approach, adding a new wired connection to a fixed location or via a different entry can result in the risks of disconnection during construction/maintenance and high installation costs. Wireless failover connectivity is a more effective and economical solution as it provides consistency and diversity by providing a physically uninterrupted connection. In addition, SD-WAN provides reliability by managing required access for system diagnostics and update/patch. Lanner&#39;s NCR-1510 and endpoints have the ability to enable Out-of-Band Management (OOBM), reducing the need for an onsite IT team. With a direct connection from the console port of an LTE adapter to the primary router at a branch location, network administrators can troubleshoot problems remotely. In this way, it has the advantage of solving problems in a timely manner. Network Bandwidth is also guaranteed during network failover with Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) technologies; through bandwidth aggregation and traffic segmentation between wired and wireless WAN links, SD-WAN allows IT to set configurations that ensure critical data comes before the wireless failover link.

Today, however, the focus of automation has shifted to increased quality and flexibility in the production process. In the automobile industry, the assembly of the pistons to the engine was done manually with an error rate of 1-1.5%. Currently this task is performed using automated machines with an error rate of 0.00001%.</p>\n\n<h2>Advantages of Industrial Automation</h2>\n\n<p>&bull; Lower operating cost: Industrial Automation eliminates the healthcare costs and paid vacations and vacations associated with a human operator. Also, Industrial Automation does not require other employee benefits such as bonus, pension insurance etc. First of all, although it is associated with a high initial cost, it saves employees&#39; monthly wages, which leads to significant cost savings for the company. The maintenance cost associated with machines used for Industrial Automation is usually less as they do not malfunction. If it fails, only computer and maintenance engineers need to repair it.</p>\n\n<p>&bull; High productivity: Although many companies hire hundreds of production workers in up to three shifts to run the plant for maximum hours, the plant still needs to be closed for maintenance and holidays. Industrial Automation fulfills the company&#39;s purpose by enabling the company to run a manufacturing facility 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. This contributes to a significant improvement in the company&#39;s productivity.</p>\n\n<p>&bull; High quality: Automation alleviates a human error. In addition, robots, unlike humans, do not experience any fatigue, which ensures that products of the same quality are produced at different times.</p>\n\n<p>&bull; High Flexibility: Adding a new task to the assembly line requires training with a human operator, but robots can be programmed to do any task. This makes the production process more flexible.</p>\n\n<p>&bull; High Information Accuracy: Adding automatic data collection can allow you to collect key production information, improve data accuracy and lower your data collection costs. This enables you to make the right decisions when it comes to reducing waste and improving your processes.</p>\n\n<p>&bull; High Safety: Industrial Automation can use robots to handle hazardous conditions, making the production line safe for workers.</p>\n\n<h2>Disadvantages of Industrial Automation</h2>\n\n<p>The high cost is the first drawback. The initial investment in moving from a human production line to an automated production line is very high.

To do this, it opens an encrypted tunnel to the other network. This transferred information is shared mutually through the tunnel. This stream is a fully encrypted stream. Therefore, it cannot be viewed from the outside. In this way, the traffic flow takes place in the specified country. For example you can log in to the sites according to Canadian rules and procedures on the network trip, if you choose Canada. VPN software or mobile apps create a network drive system for you to access this private tunnel. Acting as a virtual network adapter, this software also forwards an IP address from the network you want to connect to. The IP address, in a way, creates the identity of your connection.

In the 2000s, an intense data flow to the internet starded. In the early years of the millennium, the increase in the functions of search engines and the proliferation of social media channels enabled corporate and financial information, as well as personal information, to enter this wide network. This flow and data enabled individuals, corporate companies, in short, everyone who has a relationship with the Internet to gain an online fingerprint. This trace still processes and records the searches that individuals and institutions make on the internet.</p>\n\n<h2>The Importance of Big Data</h2>\n\n<p>At first, the uncontrolled intense data flow brought many problems with it. The name of this problem was garbage information. Uncontrolled, aimlessly stored users&#39; data was not an important issue back then. However, when the calendar showed 2009, the swine flu epidemic in the world seriously revealed the importance of big data on internet users. In the swine flu epidemic that occurred in 2009, an intense search intensity was found on the internet according to the symptoms of flu in one state of America. After this intensity, as a result of the researches carried out in the region, a report was published that the swine flu was widespread in the region where the users searched. Benefiting from the <strong>benefits of Big Data</strong>, the relevant units professionally intervened in the conditions of the epidemic by following the traces of these calls.</p>\n\n<h2>Benefits of Big Data In The Sectors</h2>\n\n<p>In line with these user-based reports, important fields such as the health sector, marketing and so on started to develop services according to the interest of their customers. The most important sector that increased in value during this period was the advertising sector. The advertisements that users complained about as empty content were replaced by advertisement content that takes into account individual interests. The personal search statistics provided by big data have benefited institutions as well as individuals.</p>\n\n<h2>Big Data Made Everyone Win</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Big data</strong> is the most important criterion for acting in a planned and focused way for sectors. Thanks to big data, companies have gained savings, time and focus. With the time gained, spending expenses decreased. Institutions, whose profits increased with decreasing expenditures, started to provide better service. With the decrease in expenses, the working conditions of the personnel have improved in parallel. Big data revealed a win-win opportunity. Rather than seeing purposeless content, individuals saw products that fit their needs. Industries also gave their focus to the people they wanted to market through big data.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://refine-tr.com/\">https://refine-tr.com/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lanner Electronics</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'Big Data is one of the most curious subjects in our changing world.

(There are also flexible PCBs) The thin connections seen on the surface of the board are Part of the conductive foil that covers the entire board at the beginning of the production phase. This conductive foil is partially etched and the remaining copper paths form a network. These paths are called the Conductor Pattern and provide the electrical connection between the electronic parts mounted on the PCB.</p>\n\n<p>PCB has two important purposes;</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Keeping electronic components together,</li>\n	<li>It is to provide electrical connection between components.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>PCB design is one of the basic steps in the production of systems. Making a good PCB design will prevent problems that may arise during production as well as minimize the financial problems associated with it. There are rules and application methods to be considered during design.</p>\n\n<h2>PCB Design Equipment</h2>\n\n<p>There are many computer-aided design packages available for commercial development programs.</p>\n\n<p>There are also very good packages available at a modest cost for those interested in PCB design as a hobby and even for students.</p>\n\n<p>The software capacity of PCB programs varies considerably. More affordable and even free software provides basic functionality, while top-level packages allow much more features to be included in the design. There are simulations, complex routing and many more features in such programs.</p>\n\n<h2>Circuit Schematic Capture</h2>\n\n<p>The first phase in development of a PCB layout is to capture a schematic for the circuit. This may be achieved in a number of ways. Circuits may be entered into a capturing tool. This may form a part of design package or it may be an external package which output may be exported in a suitable format.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to performing schematic capture, circuit simulations may be realized at this stage. Some packages may form a interface for the simulation packages. For applications such as RF circuit design of the circuit will enable the final circuit to be optimized more without forming an prototype</p>\n\n<p>When the schematic capture is completed, the electronic design of the circuit takes place in the file and may be transformed into what is termed as &ldquo;netlist&rdquo;. The Network list is the interconnectivity information and it is essentially the component pins and the circuit nodes, or nets, to which each pin connects.</p>\n\n<h2>Initial PCB Component Placement</h2>\n\n<p>It is necessary to gather a rough idea about where the components may be found and if there is enough space for all the necessary circuits before moving on the detailed PCB design and layout. This will explain the required number of layers in the board and will enable decisions about whether there is sufficient space for all the circuits.</p>\n\n<p>After making a rough guess about the circuit space and their approximate locations, a more detailed component design may be created for PCB layout. This can take into account issues such as proximity of the devices which may need to communicate with each other and other information related to RF.</p>\n\n<p>In order to components to be included in PCB layout, they need to have all the information relevant to themselves. This information will include the area occupied by the printed circuit board pads, any kind of drilling, retention areas and more. Typically, several devices may share the same footprint, therefore there is no need to enter this information for every component number. However, a library will be built for all the devices used in PCB layout design system. In this way, all the components used previously may be easily called.</p>\n\n<h2>Routing</h2>\n\n<p>Once the basic placement is completed, the next step of PCB layout is to route all connections between all the components. PCB software then route physical connections on the board according to network listings in the schematic. In order to achieve this, it wil use the available number of layers for connections by creating holes as required. Often, a layer will be allocated to be used as a ground plane and another one as a power plane. Not only this reduce the noise level but also enables low source connections to be made for power.</p>\n\n<p>Routing may use a considerable amount of computing power. This is especially valid for larger designs which may include more then three or four thousand components. When the routing is difficult because of high density of components, this may cause Routing take a significant amount of time.</p>\n\n<h2>PCB Files</h2>\n\n<p>The information for the photo graphics of PCB layout are output as Gerber files. This format is standard for PCB files and it is a numerical control file form which is used by a photo plotter. In addition to Gerber files, drill information is also generated along with screen print and photo-resist information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One of the main elements in the cost of a printed circuit board is drilling. In any desing, some holes are required for fixing as well as the ones required for any conventinal components. However, to reduce the costs it will be wise to use as few holes as possible. This way, the drill will need changing less and more time will be saved.</p>\n\n<p>Once complete, PCB information will be used in many areas of manufacturing process. The files may be used for developing a pick and place program and additionally may be used in manufacturing of PCB solder maks in order to add a solder paste to the board prior to component placement. The files also may be used to develop test programs such as &ldquo;In-Circuit Test&rdquo; (ICT) and specifically in development for any kind of nail bed test fixture.</p>\n\n<p>In this way, PCB layout is a very important element of the whole manufacturing process for any product. PCB layout is more than a design for a basic board.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://refine-tr.com/\">https://refine-tr.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Lanner Electronics:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'Printed circuit boards also known as PCB are plates made of various insulating materials with conductive tracks and islands on the surface for mounting electronic circuit elements and with solder-coated holes between the surfaces.', NULL),

Security should be evaluated and implemented in terms of all devices operating on a network. In addition, it is very important to ensure that security is uninterrupted.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few <strong>network security</strong> tools and techniques designed to help you do just that:</p>\n\n<h2>How To Ensure Network Security?</h2>\n\n<h3>Ensuring Physical Security</h3>\n\n<p>If an intruder can physically access the host device, they can easily take control of the device. Particular attention should be paid to this issue and necessary precautions should be taken. Some physical security methods that can be taken are;</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Devices should only be kept in rooms or lockers (cabinets) that the administrator has the authority to open.</li>\n	<li>It is wise to keep the names of those who have physically accessed the device in a list showing the access times.</li>\n	<li>Cables should be labeled and what they are doing should be determined. Unused cables must be removed from the network.</li>\n	<li>Access information to the device should not be kept in public.</li>\n	<li>Power sources should be located and locked out of sight. Thus, the intruder should be prevented from cutting power.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Password Management</h3>\n\n<p>The most effective way of password management is to use an approval mechanism system using &quot;LDAP&quot; or &quot;RADIUS&quot; authentication servers. Even if such a mechanism is used, a locally defined password must be available in the configuration file for the use of authorized rights. Most of the manageable devices have two different usage options called user accounts and administrator accounts. While users can only examine the interfaces and work, administrators have the right to make changes to the device settings. While keeping a password in configuration files, it is absolutely necessary to keep it encrypted. In addition, when determining a password, care should be taken that a good password does not have the properties. An effective password;</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Contains uppercase and lowercase letters.</li>\n	<li>Includes punctuation and numbers.</li>\n	<li>Can be easily remembered so it doesn&rsquo;t need to be written down.</li>\n	<li>At least eight characters long.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Anti-malware software</h3>\n\n<p>Malware such as viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, and keyloggers are designed to spread across computer systems and infect networks. The way to protect yourself from this software is through network security software designed to recognize dangerous programs and prevent them from spreading. Anti-malware and antivirus software can try to prevent malware from infecting the system, thereby minimizing the damage to the network.</p>\n\n<h3>Firewalls</h3>\n\n<p>Firewalls function much like gates that can be used to secure the borders between your network and the internet. Firewalls are used to manage network traffic, allowing authorized traffic through while blocking access to non-authorized traffic. Firewall software / devices are the building blocks of security and work in harmony with other security software / devices in the system and form the basis for future security technologies. Although firewall software is absolutely essential, it is not enough for security alone.</p>\n\n<h3>Virtual private network (VPN)</h3>\n\n<p>VPN tools are used to authenticate communication between secure networks and an endpoint device. Remote-access VPNs generally use IPsec or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for authentication, creating an encrypted line to block other parties from eavesdropping. Thanks to VPN, it is possible to both reduce our costs and move PCs and LANs in different places, which we could not do before because they were not safe and expensive, to the same platforms over the internet. In this way, it is possible for us to connect to our company while at home, access company resources, check our e-mails, and use the Intranet as if we were there.</p>\n\n<h3>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</h3>\n\n<p>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a software solution that aggregates and analyzes activity from many different resources across your entire IT infrastructure. SIEM collects security data from network devices, servers, domain controllers, and more. SIEM stores, normalizes, aggregates, and applies analytics to that data to discover trends, detect threats, and enable organizations to investigate any alerts. Basically, SIEM is a data aggregator, search, and reporting system. SIEM gathers immense amounts of data from your entire networked environment, consolidates and makes that data human accessible. With the data categorized and laid out at your fingertips, you can research data security breaches with as much detail as needed.</p>\n\n<h3>IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)</h3>\n\n<p>Intrusion Detection Systems have become one of the most important issues that are needed as a result of attacks on personal or legal pages, especially with the increase of web traffic used all over the world and the popularization of web pages in the development process of the Internet world. In addition, the possibility that the servers such as mail, dns, database, which are owned by institutions or organizations and kept open to the whole world, may be exposed to similar attacks has made Intrusion Detection Systems an indispensable part of the Internet Security field. IDS&#39;s can keep a record of the traffic they listen to and, when necessary, generate reports based on these records. When they detect an attack, they can prevent attacks, notify their administrators by e-mail or similar means, run a pre-created program, and record telnet-like connections and monitor them afterwards. With all these features, IDSs help the system to operate safely and help System Administrators monitor the System strongly.</p>\n\n<p>It is obvious that today cyber threats are more than ever in terms of both number and complexity, and therefore networks are very vulnerable to attacks that can cause great harm. However, if proactive measures are taken and the above mentioned methods are applied, network security can be achieved to a great extent.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://refine-tr.com/\">https://refine-tr.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Lanner Electronics: <a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'Network Security as the preventative measures taken to safeguard network infrastructure from unauthorized access, modification, malfunction, misuse, improper disclosure or destruction of data.', NULL),

In the modern world, vehicles owe their smooth operation to more than 50 microprocessor in-vehicle computers. On-board computers help drivers in a wide range of tasks, from securing the vehicle to saving fuel, from navigation to assisted braking, and make driving fun. This new technology has also saved many lives when it comes to accidents. Vehicles today are rapidly turning into a computer on wheels.</p>\n\n<p>So what are all these computers in vehicles actually doing? It is possible to divide their aims into a few simple categories.</p>\n\n<h2>Vehicle Computers</h2>\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Advanced Diagnostics</strong></span></h3>\n\n<p>The biggest benefits of the large number of sensors and microprocessors in your vehicle are that it is now very easy to determine the causes of problems your vehicle is experiencing. Sensors are used to observe and detect a wide range of different systems, including fuel / air mixture, sparks and much more. When one of these sensors detects any problems, it usually causes an dashboard light, such as a check engine light, to come on.</p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Entertainment</strong></span></h3>\n\n<p>In vehiche computers used in many vehicle entertainment and information systems such as GPS, video games, TVs, Internet radio and bluetooth compatibility. In-vehicle computers are very convenient, for example, to keep children busy or to create a hands-free environment while using your phone or music player, ensuring a safe ride. Today&#39;s on-board computers offer much more than a ride for everyone and also act as a source of entertainment.</p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Safety </strong></span></h3>\n\n<p>The use of computers in vehicles has made transportation much safer than before. Airbags, assisted braking, rear view cameras and more are activated by computer sensors that detect problems in the smallest fraction of a second. This is why airbags can be deployed faster than the actual event of the collision.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>ABS</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:17.4pt;\">Automatic braking systems (ABS) are a standard feature on most modern cars. If you don&rsquo;t respond to a sudden braking situation fast enough your ABS works to help you avoid a crash, and reduce the severity of a crash. The system essentially works to have the car&rsquo;s computer take over and brake for the driver.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Backup Cameras</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:17.4pt;\">Backup cameras are becoming more and more commonplace in the cars on the road. These backup cameras can provide aid to the driver when getting in and out of parking spaces and driveways. These cameras are designed to help drivers avoid backup collisions.</p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Emission Controls</strong></span></h3>\n\n<p>Another great benefit of in-car computers is that they help reduce pollution. Automakers are using in-car computers to ensure less smoke generation, which saves drivers time and money while also helping to protect the environment. On-board computers ensure that regulations for emission and fuel efficiency standards are properly met.</p>\n\n<p>Before the emission laws were passed, it was possible to build a car without a computer. But now, due to the new laws, all vehicles have at least one computer system called ECM. This system is responsible for monitoring engine emissions and adjusting the vehicle engine to keep emission levels low. This system receives the following information from different sensors in the vehicle;</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Oxygen Sensor</li>\n	<li>Air Pressure Sensor</li>\n	<li>Air Temperature Sensor</li>\n	<li>Engine Temperature Sensor</li>\n	<li>Throttle Position Sensor</li>\n	<li>Knock Sensor</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Using information from these different sensors, the on-board computer organizes different systems such as fuel injectors, spark plugs, idle speed, and more. Thanks to these regulations, your vehicle can keep emissions as low as possible.</p>\n\n<p>It can be said that the automotive industry is experiencing one of the biggest periods of change. There are an increasing number of computers inside vehicles to power new technology, and this trend does not seem to be slowing down.</p>\n\n<p>It would not be wrong to say that modern vehicles, especially high-quality, luxury vehicles and cars with more features for driver comfort and convenience have now become massive computer systems that drive on wheels. The more comfort you want to have in your car, the more computer technology you need to use.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://refine-tr.com\">https://refine-tr.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Lanner Electronics: <a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'The first computers began to be used in automobiles in the 1970s to perform basic functions such as gearbox shifting and ignition timing.', NULL),

Applications of embedded computers can range from Industrial Automation, Digital Signage, Self-autonomous Vehicles, to Space Exploration, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Typically <a href=\"https://refine-tr.com/en/lanner-products/embedded-box-pcs\"><strong>embedded computers</strong></a> are hardened devices as their use cases tend to be mostly in challenging harsh environment conditions, such as extreme temperature, vibration, shock, dust and humidity.</p>\n\n<p>There are various types of embedded computers, from rugged industrial box PCs to panel PCs, mini PCs, industrial rackmount server, vehicle computers, and IoT gateways.</p>\n\n<p>The main differences between an embedded and a desktop computer are purpose and design. Embedded computers are purposeful and dedicated equipment built from scratch to perform a specific task. It can run at maximum, with low resources, and withstand harsh conditions &mdash; something not possible with the consumer-grade computers.</p>\n\n<p>Another crucial distinction is that the general-purpose desktops come with traditional motherboards, which allow you to expand or replace its components. Embedded computers, on the other hand, have all of its components burned-in in a single Printed Circuit Board (PCB) or Motherboard.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Among the many benefits of Embedded Box PCs are;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Small Form Factor:</strong>&nbsp;One of the standout features of nearly all embedded computers is their size. Often built around small form factor motherboards like Mini-ITX&nbsp;or&nbsp;Intel&#39;s NUC, embedded computers can be installed in places where antiquated towers would never fit. Solid state storage and flexible mounting options also allow embedded PCs to be utilized in virtually any position or orientation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> In many instances embedded computers, as their name suggests, live deep inside complex systems, making reliability incredibly important. Industrial computers are engineered to provide 24 hour, uninterrupted operation, often employing carefully engineered, fanless and ventless enclosures designed to efficiently dissipate heat while protecting internal components from environmental damage ranging from dust and airborne debris to extreme temperatures, moisture and vibration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highly Reliable:</strong> Some embedded computers are designed for high reliability in critical mission-based applications like industrial or military deployments. They need to operate 24&times;7 in demanding applications and extreme environments like rugged terrains, continuous vibration, high temperatures, etc. These embedded computers can operate at a wide range of temperatures (e.g. -30&deg;C to 70&deg;C), dust-proof, and with protection from humidity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Power Efficiency:</strong> Some applications require that embedded computers remain operational, day and night. That is why these computers are designed for power efficiency. Embedded computers come with lightweight and dedicated software so they do not need lots of processing power. Another advantage of power consumption is that some embedded computers come without fans and don&rsquo;t have any moving components.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There are also various types of Embedded Box PC which are;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Rugged Industrial Box PC: </strong>The Rugged Industrial Box is excellent for applications that require processing power in harsh environment conditions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Panel PC: </strong>The Panel PC comes with an integrated display screen that allows interface with the computer and to resist shock and toxic chemicals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Mini PC:</strong> The mini-PC, although it is not compute-intensive, it can bring some intelligence to rough small and confined spaces.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Industrial Rackmount Server: </strong>Opposite to the mini-pc, the Industrial Rackmount can be used as a high intensive-compute and racked on top of other servers, without the need of A/C or optimal environments</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Vehicle Computer: </strong>The in-vehicle computer comes with wireless communication and vibrant-resistant capabilities to be used in first emergency-response vehicles, or similar applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The IoT Gateway: </strong>The IoT gateway is a type of embedded computer that can act as a bridge between different technologies. It accepts inputs from IoT sensors or video cameras, processes the data, and can output to a display, actuator, or the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>The way computers operate within the industry is not the same as how they are used at home or at the office. The industry has different requirements and standards that demand another kind of computer.</p>\n\n<p>The embedded computers are designed with the application in mind.

Dust protection is at a higher level than standard computers, especially thanks to protection classes such as IP65 - IP66.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\"><strong>Memory Units: </strong>Magnetic media (floppy disk, hard disk, CDROM), cooling system components directly and power supply</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\"><strong>Shock Impact / Vibration Protection: </strong>Disk drives are mounted with shock absorbers providing cushioning and mechanical insulation.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\"><strong>Humidity: </strong>Liquid contaminants / coolants frequently used in production and machine environments (sanding machines, machining centers, transfer lines, lathes etc.) negatively affect the computer in the facility. You can reach high relative humidity values with the industrial PC.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\"><strong>Supply Unit: </strong>Peak, fluctuating, transient voltages and noise generated by AC power supplies are very common in factory environments. The power supply of computers must be provided under all conditions and always with clean, non-variable DC voltages.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\"><strong>Electromagnetic Compatibility: </strong>Proper grounding, protective and proper insulation and electrical design must be provided in accordance with internationally accepted electrical standards.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\"><strong>Expandability and longevity: </strong>An IPC configuration provides different usage areas compared to the standard PC configuration with the expandable slots it provides. In addition, since they are more durable (for example, varnished motherboards, vibration-proof memory units, SSD (Solid State disks) using MLC (Multi Layer Cell) technology), they have a long working life.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\"><strong>Certifications: </strong>Industrial computers must offer certifications in addition to CE certification, which guarantees that they will be less affected by electrical noise in the environment.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\"><strong>Test Reports: </strong>The most important document proving that a computer is industrial is the test reports to be submitted by the manufacturer. Each manufacturer must test its product for heat, vibration, aging, water and dust resistance. It should also be able to present to the customer when requested.</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"margin-left: 0.6pt;\">Processor</h2>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.6pt;\">When purchasing an industrial computer, criteria such as the strongest and fastest processor and the highest RAM are demanded when purchasing a normal computer. Because the aim is to ensure that it is suitable for the software that will be updated over time. Therefore, users do not hesitate to strain their budgets while purchasing a computer. However, the vast majority of industrial computers do not see updates after they start to work at the point of application and are not used in different areas. For this reason, when choosing an industrial computer, not the top model processor, but a &quot;sufficient&quot; level processor should be selected.</p>\n\n<p>Today, industrial PCs are widely used in many areas, from industrial automation to data collection, from transportation to defense, from kiosks to markets. The development of industrial computers also shows the progress in science and technology. In the future, the industrial market will continue to evolve with increasing expectations.

These equipment may include core network components that serve to interconnect other network components, hybrid components, and hardware or software components located at different ports of the network.</p>\n\n<p>Network devices can be classified according to their location and role in the network.</p>\n\n<p>To briefly introduce the most commonly used and most well-known components among these;</p>\n\n<h2>Gateway</h2>\n\n<p>It can be said that Gateway is a network hardware that provides communication between data between two networks through different network protocols. We can also think of Gateway as an interpreter who helps two people who do not speak the same language or have difficulty communicating to understand each other.</p>\n\n<h2>Router</h2>\n\n<p>Router is a network device that establishes and directs communication between two networks. We can define this as the seamless delivery of a data packet from one station to another. Routers can be considered among the most important computer network equipment that maintains network traffic.</p>\n\n<h2>Switch</h2>\n\n<p>Network Switch, also known as Switch, is one of the network devices that allow computers and other network components to be connected to each other. It helps different nodes on the network to communicate in a healthy and direct way.</p>\n\n<h2>Bridge</h2>\n\n<p>It is a network device that connects two computer networks into one. It is mostly used to connect ethernet or token-ring-based networks. It can act as a hardware on its own, as well as act as a bridge with a suitable software or operating system support.</p>\n\n<h2>Hub</h2>\n\n<p>The hub is tasked with connecting multiple computer network devices together. It also works as a repeater to amplify distorted signals. There are two types of Hubs; simple and multi-port.</p>\n\n<h2>Firewall</h2>\n\n<p>Firewall is a hardware-based network security system that controls outbound packet traffic to the network based on a rule set.

What Are The Benefits For Your Business?', 3, 'blog/what_is_sase.jpg', '', '<p><strong>SASE</strong>, also known as Secure Access Service Edge, is a cyber security network that manages to combine WAN and security system into a single cloud-based system. <strong>SASE</strong> provides security service for all network applications as well as user connection. It can connect to multiple clouds using internet connections, thus providing a scalable solution for growing businesses. The system delivers data directly to the connection source, eliminating the need for an enterprise data center.</p>\n\n<p>So what benefits does <strong>SASE</strong> provide us in our business?</p>\n\n<h2>Cost Reduction</h2>\n\n<p>With SASE, businesses can offer more services and technologies through a single service provider instead of two or more, thus reducing the cost of device and unnecessary network complexity.</p>\n\n<p>Reducing network complexity means reducing the workload of IT staff. Therefore, SASE significantly reduces IT staffing costs while providing continuous coverage for network performance monitoring and security threat monitoring and response. SASE will also significantly reduce the operational load, as it does not require investment in new hardware and software.</p>\n\n<h2>WAN Flexibility and IT Agility</h2>\n\n<p><strong>SASE</strong> provides great flexibility within the WAN infrastructure. While traditional solutions require a lot of time and resources to scale up and down, a cloud-based SASE solution minimizes the IT burden, making procurement processes as easy as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Using SASE, IT can get a site online in minutes instead of weeks as on a traditional WAN. It also means less physical hardware need, less downtime and fewer additional software licenses. With these enhanced efficiencies, IT can assign staff to higher priority tasks such as security and network monitoring.</p>\n\n<h2>Increased Security</h2>\n\n<p><strong>SASE</strong> improves security in a variety of ways. First, you can block or restrict access to certain data by applying data protection methods. SASE can also make your network fully visible. In addition to all this, SASE can successfully fulfill its task of securely connecting IoT devices, which normally have a minimum of security.</p>\n\n<h2>Improving Network Performance</h2>\n\n<p>SASE&#39;s continuous network monitoring reveals the quality and performance of all connections, including virtual cloud environments and those in the data center. <strong>SASE</strong> paints a real-time picture of all inbound and outbound connections on a single portal or network interface.</p>\n\n<h2>Greater Transparency and Visibility</h2>\n\n<p>Network risk assessment can be an extremely complex and ongoing process. The environment will constantly change as connections are initiated and disconnected. What organizations need to do here is to try to understand and solve the interactions of their users, devices, applications and services, thereby minimizing the risk. <strong>SASE</strong> also comes into play here and gathers a multitude of functions in a single point, thus providing network and security transparency. This transparency is a very important detail for organizations as it will reduce the number of software agents needed and provide consistent network visibility.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, data is dispersed beyond a local data center as cloud services and remote work are becoming more common. For this reason, it has become a mandatory situation for companies to secure their data in every environment. <strong>SASE</strong> offers an extremely efficient and easy way to overcome this security issue. With its simplification of WAN deployment and the solid security measures it provides, <strong>SASE</strong> is a very important solution for all companies in this period.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://refine-tr.com\">https://refine-tr.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Lanner Electronics: <a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'SASE, also known as Secure Access Service Edge, is a cyber security network that manages to combine WAN and security system into a single cloud-based system.

Thus it will perform all the functions that a piece of hardware performs. Therefore, the software can emulate a desktop PC on a server.</p>\n\n<p>This is exactly what cloud-based IT service provides: A space where jobs can be performed and stored without the need for on-premises hardware.</p>\n\n<p>Virtualization in cloud computing can be divided into 6 main categories;</p>\n\n<h2>Server Virtualization</h2>\n\n<p>With this method, the server space is protected by combining multiple machines into a single server running multiple virtual environments. It is a method which businesses can run the same applications on multiple servers, thereby creating a &quot;fail-safe&quot; position. Even though the machines have different operating systems, each server is independent, so server environments can be moved from one place to another. The savings on hardware is the most obvious benefit of this method.</p>\n\n<h2>Data Virtualization</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Data virtualization</strong> is an approach to data management that allows an application to retrieve and manipulate data without requiring technical details about the data, such as how it is formatted at source, or where it is physically located and can provide a single customer view (or single view of any other entity) of the overall data.</p>\n\n<h2>Network Virtualization</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Network virtualization</strong> is the process of combining hardware and software network resources and network functionality into a virtual network that is a single software-based management entity. Network virtualization includes platform virtualization, often combined with resource virtualization.</p>\n\n<h2>Storage Virtualization</h2>\n\n<p>In this method, the servers do not know exactly where their data is stored and instead act like worker bees in a hive. Storage Virtualization enables data from many sources to be managed and used as if it were in a single repository.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;software thus provides a smooth operation process, consistency in performance and enhanced functionality, despite any equipment changes or malfunctions.</p>\n\n<h2>Desktop Virtualization</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike other methods, this method simulates the load of a workstation rather than a server and allows this user to access the desktop remotely. Because the workstation runs on a data center server, access to it can be both more secure and portable.</p>\n\n<h2>Application Virtualization</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Application Virtualization</strong> helps users access applications remotely. The server stores all the features of the application and all personal information, but can still run on a local workstation over the internet. An example of this is a user who needs to run two different versions of the same software.</p>\n\n<p>Virtualization software allows you to run multiple operating systems and applications simultaneously on the same server. This will lower a company&#39;s existing hardware costs and thus increase its productivity. It would not be wrong to say that virtualization is the basic technology that powers cloud computing. Virtualization is paramount to cloud compositing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://refine-tr.com\">https://refine-tr.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Lanner Electronics: <a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'To answer this question, we first need to understand the Virtualization concept thoroughly.', NULL),

Although new methods of data security are found and existing methods are tried to be improved, cyber threats are becoming more and more scary every day. The only way to get rid of these threats is to strengthen Network security.</p>\n\n<p>Network security can be defined as preventive measures taken to protect the network infrastructure against unwanted changes, malfunctions, destruction of data and unauthorized access. Various devices are used to take these precautions.</p>\n\n<p>A network security strategy should focus on three main points: Protection, detection and response. Protection encompasses all tools designed to counter any threat to network security and prevent unauthorized access. Detection refers to resources that enable to analyze network traffic and identify problems quickly. Response is the ability to react to identified threats and quickly resolve them.</p>\n\n<p>So, <strong>with which devices will we ensure Network Security</strong>? Let&#39;s take a look at a few of the most used methods</p>\n\n<p>Our first and most important tool is <strong>Firewall</strong>. Firewalls are security control software / devices between your local network and the external network. Information such as which data packets will pass and which passwords will be passed within the pre-determined policies, and which passwords will be verified are added to the firewall rule tables. In this way, the person and information traffic reaching the system is taken under control. The rules on the firewall determine who can and cannot enter the inside / outside systems, which computers and which services can be used by those who enter.</p>\n\n<p>Our second device is <strong>VPN</strong>, in other words <strong>Virtual Private Networks</strong>. Virtual private network or vpn is an Internet technology that enables connection to different networks through remote access. Because VPN creates a virtual network extension, a device connected to the network using VPN can exchange data over that network as if it were physically connected. Thanks to VPN, we can both reduce our costs and move PCs and LANs in different places, which we could not do because they were previously unsafe and expensive, to the same platforms over the internet. In this way, it is possible for us to connect to our company while at home, access company resources, check our e-mails and use the Intranet as if we were there.</p>\n\n<p>Another security measure is to use an <strong>Antivirus Software</strong>. Antivirus software, or antivirus software, also known as anti-malware, is a computer program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware. E-mail, http and ftp traffic, which are the services where viruses are most spread, are directed to the antivirus gateway based on the firewall logic. After the scanning process here, it is directed to the necessary places. With this system, viruses from outside are prevented. With the antivirus system installed on mail servers, viruses circulating in the local network via e-mail are deactivated.</p>\n\n<p>Again, one of the very effective defense methods is to use <strong>IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)</strong>. IDS (Intrusion Detection System) generally appears in two types; Server based IDS and Network based IDS. Intrusion Detection Systems continuously scan network traffic and analyze the results. In this way, any type of attack can be identified and responded quickly. IDS usually maintains a database of known attack methods to be able to quickly recognize attacks and threats and take quick action.</p>\n\n<p>Another powerful tool we can use for network protection is <strong>Anomaly Detection</strong>. Network Anomaly Detection Engines, in other words ADE, allow the network to be analyzed so that if any breach occurs in the network, we are alerted quickly enough to respond.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we can mention <strong>Network Segmentation</strong> as an important Network security measure. There are many types of network traffic, each associated with different security risks. Network Segmentation allows us to reach the right traffic without risk while limiting the traffic from risky and suspicious sources.</p>\n\n<p>Reliable network security software and hardware, combined with the right policies and smart strategies, can minimize the impact of cyberattacks and eliminate concerns about Network security.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://refine-tr.com\">https://refine-tr.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Lanner Electronics: <a href=\"https://www.lannerinc.com\">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\n', 'With the digital age dominating our lives and the increasing interest in technology, data security has become an even more priority issue.', NULL),
