(15, 'WHAT IS SD WAN?', 'what-is-sd-wan', 'SD-WAN is short for Software-Defined Wide Area Networking.', '<p><strong>SD-WAN</strong>&nbsp;is short for Software-Defined Wide Area Networking. It refers to the application of software-defined networking (SDN) technology with a special system applied to WAN connections, such as broadband internet, 4G, LTE or MPLS. It is a system that uses software to make wide area networks more intelligent and flexible. The main goal of SD-WAN technology is to provide a quality, secure and simple cloud-enabled WAN connection with as open and software-based technology as possible. This can be used to provide basic WAN connectivity, or it also provides you with top business services such as VPN, WAN optimization and applications distribution control (ADC).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Software-defined wide area network or SD-WAN has advantages over traditional hardware-based networking. It is much easier to manage compared to legacy WAN systems. It can be summarized as a flexible, cost-saving, fast and reliable system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Does SD-WAN System Work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SD-WAN</strong>&nbsp;connectivity stands for next-generation network performance. SD-WAN has the possibility to use many WAN connections (XDSL, MPLS, Cellular and fiber) simultaneously. SD-WAN technology comes to the fore with its 4 main advantages which are shown below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Supports multiple connection types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; It has dynamic working alternatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; It has a simple interface to manage the WAN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Supports VPNs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Problems Does SD-WAN Solve?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest advantage of&nbsp;<strong>SD-WAN</strong>&nbsp;is cost saving. At the same time, it provides the user with the advantages of guaranteed bandwidth, predictable latency and privacy. SD-WAN provides simplicity for complex networks. With the development of technology, it has become very necessary for every business, workplace or agency to work through the cloud system. At the same time, interest in software as a service (SaaS) is growing rapidly. Traditional WAN is not considered suitable for today&#39;s business processes. The reason for this is that all traffic, including those going to the cloud, is moved from the branches to the center and this causes delays. SD-WAN does not compromise on security and data privacy and offers high performance especially for critical applications. So lower costs are highly advantageous thanks to higher bandwidth efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://refine-tr.com/">https://refine-tr.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lanner Electronics:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lannerinc.com/">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\r\n', 1, 'attachments/blog/what-is-sd-wan.jpeg', 0, '5', '', '', '2022-01-08 11:13:28', 'admin'),
(14, 'HOW TO ENSURE NETWORK SECURITY?', 'how-to-ensure-network-security', 'Network Security as the preventative measures taken to safeguard network infrastructure from unauthorized access, modification, malfunction, misuse, improper disclosure or destruction of data.', '<p><strong>Network Security</strong>&nbsp;as the preventative measures taken to safeguard network infrastructure from unauthorized access, modification, malfunction, misuse, improper disclosure or destruction of data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ensuring the security of a network is a matter of great importance and requires great attention. Security should be evaluated and implemented in terms of all devices operating on a network. In addition, it is very important to ensure that security is uninterrupted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few&nbsp;<strong>network security</strong>&nbsp;tools and techniques designed to help you do just that:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How To Ensure Network Security?</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ensuring Physical Security</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If an intruder can physically access the host device, they can easily take control of the device. Particular attention should be paid to this issue and necessary precautions should be taken. Some physical security methods that can be taken are;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Devices should only be kept in rooms or lockers (cabinets) that the administrator has the authority to open.</li>\r\n	<li>It is wise to keep the names of those who have physically accessed the device in a list showing the access times.</li>\r\n	<li>Cables should be labeled and what they are doing should be determined. Unused cables must be removed from the network.</li>\r\n	<li>Access information to the device should not be kept in public.</li>\r\n	<li>Power sources should be located and locked out of sight. Thus, the intruder should be prevented from cutting power.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Password Management</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most effective way of password management is to use an approval mechanism system using &quot;LDAP&quot; or &quot;RADIUS&quot; authentication servers. Even if such a mechanism is used, a locally defined password must be available in the configuration file for the use of authorized rights. Most of the manageable devices have two different usage options called user accounts and administrator accounts. While users can only examine the interfaces and work, administrators have the right to make changes to the device settings. While keeping a password in configuration files, it is absolutely necessary to keep it encrypted. In addition, when determining a password, care should be taken that a good password does not have the properties. An effective password;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Contains uppercase and lowercase letters.</li>\r\n	<li>Includes punctuation and numbers.</li>\r\n	<li>Can be easily remembered so it doesn&rsquo;t need to be written down.</li>\r\n	<li>At least eight characters long.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Anti-malware software</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Malware such as viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, and keyloggers are designed to spread across computer systems and infect networks. The way to protect yourself from this software is through network security software designed to recognize dangerous programs and prevent them from spreading. Anti-malware and antivirus software can try to prevent malware from infecting the system, thereby minimizing the damage to the network.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Firewalls</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Firewalls function much like gates that can be used to secure the borders between your network and the internet. Firewalls are used to manage network traffic, allowing authorized traffic through while blocking access to non-authorized traffic. Firewall software / devices are the building blocks of security and work in harmony with other security software / devices in the system and form the basis for future security technologies. Although firewall software is absolutely essential, it is not enough for security alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Virtual private network (VPN)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>VPN tools are used to authenticate communication between secure networks and an endpoint device. Remote-access VPNs generally use IPsec or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for authentication, creating an encrypted line to block other parties from eavesdropping. Thanks to VPN, it is possible to both reduce our costs and move PCs and LANs in different places, which we could not do before because they were not safe and expensive, to the same platforms over the internet. In this way, it is possible for us to connect to our company while at home, access company resources, check our e-mails, and use the Intranet as if we were there.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a software solution that aggregates and analyzes activity from many different resources across your entire IT infrastructure. SIEM collects security data from network devices, servers, domain controllers, and more. SIEM stores, normalizes, aggregates, and applies analytics to that data to discover trends, detect threats, and enable organizations to investigate any alerts. Basically, SIEM is a data aggregator, search, and reporting system. SIEM gathers immense amounts of data from your entire networked environment, consolidates and makes that data human accessible. With the data categorized and laid out at your fingertips, you can research data security breaches with as much detail as needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Intrusion Detection Systems have become one of the most important issues that are needed as a result of attacks on personal or legal pages, especially with the increase of web traffic used all over the world and the popularization of web pages in the development process of the Internet world. In addition, the possibility that the servers such as mail, dns, database, which are owned by institutions or organizations and kept open to the whole world, may be exposed to similar attacks has made Intrusion Detection Systems an indispensable part of the Internet Security field. IDS&#39;s can keep a record of the traffic they listen to and, when necessary, generate reports based on these records. When they detect an attack, they can prevent attacks, notify their administrators by e-mail or similar means, run a pre-created program, and record telnet-like connections and monitor them afterwards. With all these features, IDSs help the system to operate safely and help System Administrators monitor the System strongly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is obvious that today cyber threats are more than ever in terms of both number and complexity, and therefore networks are very vulnerable to attacks that can cause great harm. However, if proactive measures are taken and the above mentioned methods are applied, network security can be achieved to a great extent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://refine-tr.com/">https://refine-tr.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lanner Electronics:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lannerinc.com/">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\r\n', 1, 'attachments/blog/how-to-ensure-network-security.jpeg', 0, '5', '', '', '2022-01-08 11:13:30', 'admin'),
(16, 'WHAT ARE VCPE AND UCPE?', 'what-are-vcpe-and-ucpe', 'Developing technology and scalable networks are needed to provide high-quality services in many areas.', '<p>Developing technology and scalable networks are needed to provide high-quality services in many areas. Direct computing to the vCPE (network edge), where data is created and consumed, is critical to exploit opportunities and operational savings. vCPE is needed as much as uCPE. So&nbsp;<strong>what are vCPE and uCPE</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>what is SD-WAN vCPE,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>what is whitebox routing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are vCPE and uCPE? The vCPE resides inside your network just outside the network hub. This edge is based on locations, such as regional data centers, next-generation central offices (NGCOs), hard-wired access points, wireless access base stations, and radio access networks (RANs). If you would like to find out the answer for the following questions: what is vCPE, why is it used, what is uCPE, why is it used, and what are the differences between uCPE and vCPE?; Continue reading our article to learn about vCPE and uCPE.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is vCPE? Why is it used?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Migrating computing to vCPE allows for effective routing of workload placement. In addition, it has many advantages. These are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>High speed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving data processing and analysis to vCPE helps improving system responsiveness. That makes transactions happen faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advanced network traffic management</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By reducing the amount of data sent over the network to the cloud, large amounts of data are transferred with bandwidth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advanced security features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a correctly implemented edge computing solution, it may be possible to increase data security by limiting the transferred data over.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is uCPE? Why is it used?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, the questions about what is uCPE and vCPE are the same. After the vCPE mentioned above, uCPE consists of Software Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) running on a standard operating system hosted on an open server. A successful uCPE deployment supports a multi-vendor, multi-component architecture. That&#39;s why uCPE brings the power of the cloud to the telecommunications network. In addition, the reason for using uCPE is that it has several benefits. These benefits are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Segregation of network devices into hardware and software components from multiple vendors</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Using out-of-the-box (COTS) servers to break cost curves</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Using a mix of open source and commercial software components</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Collaboration with customers and suppliers</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next topic is what SD-WAN vCPE is. It leverages the power of software to manage connectivity and services between software-defined data centres. In addition, remote connections and connectivity between cloud systems simplify administration and service management. In this case, the existing router structure is used during the application process. Furthermore, virtual customer facility equipment (vCPE) is also among the choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the differences between uCPE and vCPE?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>uCPE is an advanced version of vCPE that solves some of its limitations. It is also based on software and VNFs. Besides that, virtualization is performed by the branches themselves. For this, Lanner has a recommendation for hardware suitable to run multiple Virtual Network Functions (VNF).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NCA-1516</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NCA-1516, a desktop network device powered by the C3000, is capable of both mmWave 5G and Sub-6GHz 5G. Besides, its WiFi6 is compatible with both 2.4G and 5G. The NCA-1516 is enhanced with extensive networking features and configurations for vCPE/uCPE and edge security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NCA-2513</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designed with the C3758, C3558, C3558R or C3338R CPU, the NCA-2513 offers a higher TDP and higher frequency with the ability to handle up to 8 cores. Also, includes Intel&reg; QAT, 8x Ethernet ports, 64GB system memory, two dual Gen3 bypass (with SKU), 1x NIC module slot, 1x M.2, 1x PCIe x8 or x4 FH/HL (with SKU), and compatibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As&nbsp;<strong>Refine</strong>, we supply products of&nbsp;<strong>Lanner Electronics Inc.</strong>&nbsp;which is a world leading provider of advanced network devices, embedded computers, virtual platforms, durable industrial hardware design.

This increasing demand causes the need for bandwidth.&nbsp;<strong>Wifi 6E</strong>&nbsp;is being developed to meet this need. A new technology, Wifi 6E, is among the technologies that is going to be more and more popular in the future. In addition, 6E offers the necessary infrastructure to prevent many devices from having problems connecting to the internet. So, what do you need to know about the 6E? If you are interested, please continue reading our article for more information on what is&nbsp;<strong>wifi 6E</strong>, what it does, coverage, and router.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is Wifi 6E?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wifi 6E</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>technology&nbsp;</strong>that can operate in the 6 GHz band. In addition, the 6E has technology that allows 14 additional 80 MHz channels and 7 additional 160 MHz channels. These channels do not overlap with each other. Also, it helps to reduce congestion in areas and regions where many networks operate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wifi 6E</strong>&nbsp;has the same features as the 802.11ax (Wifi 6 standard) infrastructure. Besides, there is a difference between these two technologies. In short, the 6E only exchanges data on the 6 GHz frequency. So, what does 6E do?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Does Wifi 6E Do?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federal Communications Board (FCC) has announced the availability of the 6 GHz band for 6E. The use of the 6 GHz band allows access to higher speeds than the existing wifi 6. It is necessary to have a 6E compatible device to benefit from this connection speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This technology, which offers 6 GHz frequency, provides its users with higher efficiency than standard WLANs. Wifi 6E technology was developed for use in public areas. In addition, with the iFi6E 6 GHz frequency, users can output a large amount of data. As well as, the scope of wireless internet has been expanded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the&nbsp;<strong>6E technology</strong>&nbsp;offered to users, the image quality of 4K and 8K resolution videos and virtual reality applications has increased. For this reason, 6E technology is primarily preferred by public institutions and organizations. The 6E technology will be offered to standard users through public institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Wifi 6E Router&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Wifi 6E routers are devices used to create next-generation routers. These appliances have been developed to take advantage of 6E technology. Due to the development of this technology, there are limited compatible device options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wifi 6E technology</strong>&nbsp;is developed on wifi 6 technology, but it is a more advanced version. In addition, the 6E stands out in crowded areas where broadcast waves are intense. It is stated that the average speed of public network users used in a crowded environment will increase at least four times with Wifi 6E.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Wifi 6E Coverage</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wifi 6E</strong>&nbsp;has many advantages, and its coverage area is a technology product. The 6E is fast and powerful as well as wide-ranging. With this technology, you can enable a large numeral of devices to connect to your network. In addition, 6E has a more vital security protocol so you can establish a more secure connection. Also, 6E technology ensures efficient use of bandwidth. Being a fast technological product, it shows high performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this technology, communication between devices is provided via a router. It means that the device does not always keep the antenna on to send and receive signals. Therefore, it consumes less battery and has longer battery life. Wifi 6E is a technology that eliminates the difference between a wired connection and a wireless connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the high-frequency 6GHz band for gigabit performance the new 6E speed is granted. Wavelengths in the higher frequency bands cover shorter distances. That means that the coverage will not extend to the 2.4 GHz band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Refine, we engineer&nbsp;<strong>Lanner Electronics Inc</strong>., advanced network devices, embedded computers, virtual platforms, durable industrial hardware design.

That''s why 5G hardware components must have an edge-to-core framework that offers the possible attack surface.', '<p><strong>5G technology</strong>&nbsp;functions require workload code and data protection, secure key management, and application programming interface (API) security. That&#39;s why&nbsp;<strong>5G hardware components</strong>&nbsp;must have an edge-to-core framework that offers the possible attack surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An ideal 5G network security protection should address security at every layer, protecting all systems from every sensor node to the cloud. Embedded security ICs provide features; such as advanced physical security layers, cryptographic algorithms, secure boot, encryption, secure key storage, digital signature creation, and verification. So what are requirements to ensure&nbsp;<strong>5G hardware security</strong>?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Things to Do to Ensure 5G Network Security</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In 5G technology, perimeter-based security controls such as a basic firewall or data encryption are not acceptable to ensure network security. In addition, service providers use IntelR embedded hardware security features to reduce cybersecurity risks and increase overall productivity and usability. Three main areas of protection are required for effective 5G hardware. They are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Key Management Security</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Keys are highly effective for providing network, workload security, authentication, and encryption. Strong authentication requires private security keys and digital key management protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Crypto Boost</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Crypto acceleration provides cryptographic functions in hardware rather than software. That helps to maximize the processing of encrypted network traffic. In addition, network security improves processing performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Platform Firmware Durability</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Each platform should have main firmware components for booting and operating requirements. Platform firmware must be original and have reliable connectivity for the entire platform. Then it can handle critical software operations and protect against highly sensitive data intrusion like malware, spyware, ransomware, and data leakage. At the same time, service providers can develop the potential of 5G technology by securing these areas above. Moreover, service providers are critical to benefit from emerging trends such as confidential computing and gain new service opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5G Network Security Components</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A useful 5G network security needs to be built on solid foundations. For this, Lanner network devices provided by Refine Inc offer many solutions. These solutions are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Secure key management of service providers</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Crypto acceleration and platform firmware flexibility</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provides core hardware-based security solution to help solve 5G security challenges. Lanner ensures the continuous improvement of network security and allows service providers to meet evolving security requirements. The 5G hardware components are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>HTCA-E400</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>HTCA-E400; 5G Open RAN with comprehensive configuration has built-in AI boost for Edge Cloud and AI edge-oriented applications.

(31, 'IMPORTANCE OF NETWORK DEVICES', 'importance-of-network-devices', 'Network allows users to share hardware and software resources in computer systems.', '<p>Network, in its most general definition, is a communication and interaction network. It can be done easily with all kinds of communication networks and it gives trouble-free results. It is an undeniable fact that most individuals and communities in the world are members of any network. While the individual network is concentrated in areas such as social media, the collective network is preferred by companies and large companies. A network is a large mesh that drives the sharing of content, location, and information that individuals and communities can access instantly. While the contents are sometimes realized in line with personal needs; sometimes it is driven by a community&#39;s request for information and data transfer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Function of Network Devices</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The most valuable medium for network devices is the area created by communities and companies. Due to their large structures, companies need instant, fast and high quality data transfer. In the global age, it is vital to navigate the dense data. The function of network devices is to increase the coordination and cohesion of companies. Intense information flow is extremely important for healthy communication with customers. The first step of healthy communication is defined as a strong network and infrastructure. Network security is very important. The importance of network devices has a key place here. The stronger the network infrastructure in a workplace, the higher the rate of profit and efficiency. The gained stability line is successfully maintained. This line of stability reached is the most important factor of growth and development. As with every operating system, network systems also have key devices. These devices support all this positive progress and increase efficiency. Network security is a very important issue in this area. Institutions work overtime to avoid this problem in their business. Network security should be performed with known and efficient devices. It is recommended that these devices are carefully selected by institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hub</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Hubs occupy a key place in the network. It increases the possibilities of computers to share from server to server. Making contact from one computer to another with hubs is known as the preferred and popular method. There is only one defect observed in hubs. The current defect of the system is that the network breaks down and fails when there are more than one server at the same time. Although hub technology is widely used today, it can be shown as an old and less effective device. The importance of network devices is important in communication as well as in security.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Switch</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Switch is shown as a more useful and advanced technology network device compared to Hubs. The use of switches provides the institutions high maneuverability and performance gain in network networks. Another important effect of this device is the independent communication channel it offers to each computer. When more than one user comes together on switches, there is no problem. This device, which can host more than one user, is known as the most important example of healthy interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Repeater</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The network power of repeaters is quite strong compared to other devices. It is one of the favorite devices of many institutions with the high performance it offers to users. Repeater optimizes the system to the network by revising and updating the Ethernet packets it is connected to. If deformation or deterioration has occurred in the packages found, it eliminates these problems and increases the quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bridge</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Bridge is also known as bridge device. Connecting two TCP/IP devices, this system also controls physical connections. In addition to its superior capacity in its physical connection, data flows in the network are under its control. It receives incoming data by processing it without any problems. If the processed data is correct and problem-free, it completes the last step by making the necessary directions. The importance of network devices continues to come to the fore with the ease provided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Router</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Routers stand out as a more functional device than Bridges. It is known as the most preferred system of professional works with the ease it creates in routing tools. It can route over the LAN used by a user to other LAN points or WAN users. This system, which does many important works, is the favorite of institutions. Another explanation for its diversity and high efficiency is that the device has its own operating system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Firewall</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>How to ensure network security with Firewall? Firewall is a known security operating system. Firewall is used at individual points as well as in corporate places. Firewall&#39;s function is quite simple and important. It controls the system security requirements standing between the local network and the external network. Its function is to filter and direct the incoming data according to the criteria given by the users. When users tell the device the data criteria they want, the firewall operating system manages and directs this data with the specified principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://refine-tr.com/">https://refine-tr.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lanner Electronics:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lannerinc.com/">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\r\n', 1, 'attachments/blog/importance-of-network-devices.jpeg', 0, '0', '', '', '2022-03-09 12:47:08', 'admin'),

It is also a product that demonstrates that it can alleviate IT frustrations, maintain bandwidth efficiency, and provide uninterrupted connectivity to the cloud. Not using SD-WAN can result in not only unplanned network outages, financial and operational losses, but also waste of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Network Failover systems are completely dependent on uplink/downlink status. Therefore, single-cable lines are no longer sufficient for backup connection and redundancy. In a traditional approach, adding a new wired connection to a fixed location or via a different entry can result in the risks of disconnection during construction/maintenance and high installation costs. Wireless failover connectivity is a more effective and economical solution as it provides consistency and diversity by providing a physically uninterrupted connection. In addition, SD-WAN provides reliability by managing required access for system diagnostics and update/patch. Lanner&#39;s NCR-1510 and endpoints have the ability to enable Out-of-Band Management (OOBM), reducing the need for an onsite IT team. With a direct connection from the console port of an LTE adapter to the primary router at a branch location, network administrators can troubleshoot problems remotely. In this way, it has the advantage of solving problems in a timely manner. Network Bandwidth is also guaranteed during network failover with Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) technologies; through bandwidth aggregation and traffic segmentation between wired and wireless WAN links, SD-WAN allows IT to set configurations that ensure critical data comes before the wireless failover link. As a result, all business-critical traffic can continue to flow with higher bandwidth Gigabit Class LTE and 5G connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No More Compromising Security</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SD-WAN allows for partitioning of mission-critical traffic and assets and well-protected against vulnerabilities. For example, in the retail or financial industries, confidential application traffic within the enterprise allows protection from external threats by leveraging SD-WAN&#39;s various security solutions. SD-WAN platforms provide a resilient and flexible network solution to unavoidable system disruptions while maintaining the quality and security of MPLS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://refine-tr.com/">https://refine-tr.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lanner Electronics:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lannerinc.com/">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\r\n', 1, 'attachments/blog/sd-wan-for-mission-critical-applications.jpeg', 0, '0', '', '', '2022-05-09 13:16:32', 'admin'),

It refers to another level beyond mechanization within the scope of industrialization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Increases Quality and Flexibility in Your Production Process</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of early automation was to increase productivity (as automated systems can run 24 hours a day) and reduce the cost associated with human operators. Today, however, the focus of automation has shifted to increased quality and flexibility in the production process. In the automobile industry, the assembly of the pistons to the engine was done manually with an error rate of 1-1.5%. Currently this task is performed using automated machines with an error rate of 0.00001%.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Advantages of Industrial Automation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Lower operating cost: Industrial Automation eliminates the healthcare costs and paid vacations and vacations associated with a human operator. Also, Industrial Automation does not require other employee benefits such as bonus, pension insurance etc. First of all, although it is associated with a high initial cost, it saves employees&#39; monthly wages, which leads to significant cost savings for the company. The maintenance cost associated with machines used for Industrial Automation is usually less as they do not malfunction. If it fails, only computer and maintenance engineers need to repair it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; High productivity: Although many companies hire hundreds of production workers in up to three shifts to run the plant for maximum hours, the plant still needs to be closed for maintenance and holidays. Industrial Automation fulfills the company&#39;s purpose by enabling the company to run a manufacturing facility 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. This contributes to a significant improvement in the company&#39;s productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; High quality: Automation alleviates a human error. In addition, robots, unlike humans, do not experience any fatigue, which ensures that products of the same quality are produced at different times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; High Flexibility: Adding a new task to the assembly line requires training with a human operator, but robots can be programmed to do any task. This makes the production process more flexible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; High Information Accuracy: Adding automatic data collection can allow you to collect key production information, improve data accuracy and lower your data collection costs. This enables you to make the right decisions when it comes to reducing waste and improving your processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; High Safety: Industrial Automation can use robots to handle hazardous conditions, making the production line safe for workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Disadvantages of Industrial Automation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The high cost is the first drawback. The initial investment in moving from a human production line to an automated production line is very high. In addition, training employees to use this new sophisticated equipment entails significant costs. Industrial Automation is gaining more and more acceptance from various industries lately due to its great benefits such as increased efficiency, quality and safety at lower costs.</p>\r\n', 1, 'attachments/blog/what-is-industrial-automation.jpeg', 0, '0', '', '', '2022-06-09 13:19:06', 'admin'),

Artificial intelligence studies started in 1950 and have been continued with great momentum until today. Artificial intelligence, which feeds movie and series scenarios, especially is being used successfully in some specific subjects in the fields of finance, medicine and engineering. Artificial intelligence is essentially independent products that can extract meaningful information from the collected data and make logical decisions as a result of this information. It is possible to talk about the main components that make up artificial intelligence. These are; machine learning, planning, robotics, speech, vision, expert systems and natural language processing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The 7 basic categories that make up artificial intelligence are:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Machine learning: Machine learning is divided into tutorial, non-tutorial and deep learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Speech component: It is divided into two as text-to-speech synthesis (MKS) and text-to-speech synthesis (KMS).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Vision: It is applied in two different ways as image processing and machine vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Natural language processing: It has processes such as classification, machine translation, content extraction, text generation and question answering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most basic point to be achieved in artificial intelligence is to create software that resembles the human brain but has 0 risk of error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Should We Be Afraid of Artificial Intelligence?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artificial intelligence has always been a subject of attention. In particular, stories such as robots will rise up and wage war against humans or take over the world are quite interesting. But artificial intelligence is being developed purely to advance medical, engineering, and technology. In difficult surgeries, the risk of errors in surgeries is reduced thanks to the robotic arms developed to avoid human errors.

To do this, it opens an encrypted tunnel to the other network. This transferred information is shared mutually through the tunnel. This stream is a fully encrypted stream. Therefore, it cannot be viewed from the outside. In this way, the traffic flow takes place in the specified country. For example you can log in to the sites according to Canadian rules and procedures on the network trip, if you choose Canada. VPN software or mobile apps create a network drive system for you to access this private tunnel. Acting as a virtual network adapter, this software also forwards an IP address from the network you want to connect to. The IP address, in a way, creates the identity of your connection. With this ID, you can log into the networks of different countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to Use VPN?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>VPN is very easy to use. The interface is quite easy. You need to access VPN networks that are open to the public, especially if a VPN is to be used to access blocked sites. There are 2 different options for VPN usage. One of these options is to take advantage of paid services. Paid VPN services are pretty safe. The second method is to take advantage of the VPN service by using free software or applications. In the free VPN service, you have to manually adjust the settings. For this, it is important to have technical knowledge. You always run the risk of experiencing security problems with free VPN systems. For this reason you should research free VPN systems and use reliable apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Does a VPN Work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The VPN client works by creating a virtual network drive between two points. It then forwards an IP to the user from the opposite network. The user gains access to allowed connections with this IP. The network drive created by the VPN is encrypted. Therefore, those who have knowledge in this field know that the user exists. However, data transmitted over the network is not recognized because the network is encrypted. VPN connection hides online data traffic. Therefore, it also prevents them from being accessed from the outside. Unencrypted data can be viewed by anyone who has access to the network and wants to see it.

Network provides services in many different areas for individual and corporate uses. While services become social media channels for individual preferences, they operate differently in corporate businesses. The network comes to the fore in individual networks, in the communication of people, obtaining information, arranging personal information. Networks with their strong infrastructure allow a person to solve any problem at home, despite being in a different city, through channels with internet access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People own individualized control mechanisms with powerful network and devices. Corporate businesses, on the other hand, provide internal coordination and effective communication with external connections, with strong networks. Individual or corporate accessibility, which has become widespread with the networks, brings some problems. The first question that comes to mind on the subject: How is network security ensured? Network security is done through programs that protect individual/corporate data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Firewall</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Firewall is one of the most preferred tools in protecting individual/corporate data. Firewall is described as the first step of defense against cyber attacks. It is the first defense mechanism between the local network and the external network. This program, which controls security points between the internal and external network, is adjusted according to individual / corporate requests. Firewall, when installed, compares the connected network with the desired content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>VPN</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer to &ldquo;How is network security ensured&rdquo; question is a VPN program. VPN becomes an important resource in establishing reliable connection between devices.

It can be done easily with all kinds of communication networks and it gives trouble-free results. It is an undeniable fact that most individuals and communities in the world are members of any network. While the individual network is concentrated in areas such as social media, the collective network is preferred by companies and large companies. A network is a large mesh that drives the sharing of content, location, and information that individuals and communities can access instantly. While the contents are sometimes realized in line with personal needs; sometimes it is driven by a community&#39;s request for information and data transfer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Function of Network Devices</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The most valuable medium for network devices is the area created by communities and companies. Due to their large structures, companies need instant, fast and high quality data transfer. In the global age, it is vital to navigate the dense data. The function of network devices is to increase the coordination and cohesion of companies. Intense information flow is extremely important for healthy communication with customers. The first step of healthy communication is defined as a strong network and infrastructure. Network security is very important. The importance of network devices has a key place here. The stronger the network infrastructure in a workplace, the higher the rate of profit and efficiency. The gained stability line is successfully maintained. This line of stability reached is the most important factor of growth and development. As with every operating system, network systems also have key devices. These devices support all this positive progress and increase efficiency. Network security is a very important issue in this area. Institutions work overtime to avoid this problem in their business. Network security should be performed with known and efficient devices. It is recommended that these devices are carefully selected by institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hub</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Hubs occupy a key place in the network. It increases the possibilities of computers to share from server to server. Making contact from one computer to another with hubs is known as the preferred and popular method. There is only one defect observed in hubs. The current defect of the system is that the network breaks down and fails when there are more than one server at the same time. Although hub technology is widely used today, it can be shown as an old and less effective device. The importance of network devices is important in communication as well as in security.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Switch</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Switch is shown as a more useful and advanced technology network device compared to Hubs. The use of switches provides the institutions high maneuverability and performance gain in network networks. Another important effect of this device is the independent communication channel it offers to each computer. When more than one user comes together on switches, there is no problem. This device, which can host more than one user, is known as the most important example of healthy interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Repeater</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The network power of repeaters is quite strong compared to other devices. It is one of the favorite devices of many institutions with the high performance it offers to users. Repeater optimizes the system to the network by revising and updating the Ethernet packets it is connected to. If deformation or deterioration has occurred in the packages found, it eliminates these problems and increases the quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bridge</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Bridge is also known as bridge device. Connecting two TCP/IP devices, this system also controls physical connections. In addition to its superior capacity in its physical connection, data flows in the network are under its control. It receives incoming data by processing it without any problems. If the processed data is correct and problem-free, it completes the last step by making the necessary directions. The importance of network devices continues to come to the fore with the ease provided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Router</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Routers stand out as a more functional device than Bridges.

The 4.0 zero industrial revolution, named after the previous three industrial breakthroughs, brought many innovations. The 4.0 revolution actually started in England in the 18th century, about hundreds of years ago, with three historical industrial breakthroughs. The process, which started with water and steam machines in the first industrial revolution, led to the beginning of a different era in the world with the introduction of electricity. The industrial revolution brought about four revolutions after this process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1970&rsquo;s, in the industrial sector, where different methods were discussed, the age of automation became indispensable for production tools for forty years. During this period, mechanics and electronics merged under a single name. The hybrid model of mechanics and electricity has revealed a new technology, automation. Automation has left its place to digitalization and robot technologies with mechanical and electronic models. The automation revolution, which lasted about forty years, reached a different point with the arrival of the internet in the early 2000s. With the introduction of the Internet, the 4.0 industrial age has begun.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Industry 4.0 Innovation In Technology</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common question these days is &quot;What is Industry 4.0?&quot; The beginning of the 4.0 era continued with the widespread use of the internet in production. The technology developing in the age of 4.0 has enabled new developments to occur in the production era with smart machines, advanced operating systems and artificial intelligence. These developments, as in every period, developed the industry sector the most. Artificial intelligence has been one of the most important tools of this forward leap in the industry. With artificial intelligence, technical experience, speed and efficiency, and smart machines, production increased exponentially, and new sectors and markets were opened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the 4.0 revolution, factories have reached high production capacities with less fuel, labor and energy. This leap in production attracted the attention of manufacturers. Businesses that benefited greatly from time, energy and profit with 4.0 increased their annual turnover to the same extent. This situation led to the growth of businesses and enabled them to have a say in the world market.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Does Industry 4.0 Aim For?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>What is aimed with&nbsp;<strong>Industry 4.0</strong>&nbsp;is to maximize production capability. It is aimed to shorten the time between supply and demand and to enable consumers to reach the products more easily. Industrial companies working with consumer index in high production aim to get rid of the environment and the world from some unnecessary factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Experiences With Industry 4.0?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Environmentally friendly production lines with a sufficient number of qualified work force began to be preferred. This savings realized in many areas ensured that a significant amount of money was not lost during the production phase. As money was saved during production, important developments were experienced in many areas such as social welfare level and income equality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://refine-tr.com/">https://refine-tr.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lanner Electronics</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lannerinc.com/">https://www.lannerinc.com</a></p>\r\n', 1, 'attachments/blog/what-is-industry-4.0-industry-4.0-industrial-revolutions.jpg', 0, '0', '', '', '2022-07-09 13:26:17', 'admin'),

In the 2000s, an intense data flow to the internet starded. In the early years of the millennium, the increase in the functions of search engines and the proliferation of social media channels enabled corporate and financial information, as well as personal information, to enter this wide network. This flow and data enabled individuals, corporate companies, in short, everyone who has a relationship with the Internet to gain an online fingerprint. This trace still processes and records the searches that individuals and institutions make on the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Importance of Big Data</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, the uncontrolled intense data flow brought many problems with it. The name of this problem was garbage information. Uncontrolled, aimlessly stored users&#39; data was not an important issue back then. However, when the calendar showed 2009, the swine flu epidemic in the world seriously revealed the importance of big data on internet users. In the swine flu epidemic that occurred in 2009, an intense search intensity was found on the internet according to the symptoms of flu in one state of America. After this intensity, as a result of the researches carried out in the region, a report was published that the swine flu was widespread in the region where the users searched.

(There are also flexible PCBs) The thin connections seen on the surface of the board are Part of the conductive foil that covers the entire board at the beginning of the production phase. This conductive foil is partially etched and the remaining copper paths form a network. These paths are called the Conductor Pattern and provide the electrical connection between the electronic parts mounted on the PCB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PCB has two important purposes;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Keeping electronic components together,</li>\r\n	<li>It is to provide electrical connection between components.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>PCB design is one of the basic steps in the production of systems. Making a good PCB design will prevent problems that may arise during production as well as minimize the financial problems associated with it. There are rules and application methods to be considered during design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PCB Design Equipment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many computer-aided design packages available for commercial development programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also very good packages available at a modest cost for those interested in PCB design as a hobby and even for students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The software capacity of PCB programs varies considerably. More affordable and even free software provides basic functionality, while top-level packages allow much more features to be included in the design. There are simulations, complex routing and many more features in such programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Circuit Schematic Capture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first phase in development of a PCB layout is to capture a schematic for the circuit. This may be achieved in a number of ways. Circuits may be entered into a capturing tool. This may form a part of design package or it may be an external package which output may be exported in a suitable format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to performing schematic capture, circuit simulations may be realized at this stage. Some packages may form a interface for the simulation packages. For applications such as RF circuit design of the circuit will enable the final circuit to be optimized more without forming an prototype</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the schematic capture is completed, the electronic design of the circuit takes place in the file and may be transformed into what is termed as &ldquo;netlist&rdquo;. The Network list is the interconnectivity information and it is essentially the component pins and the circuit nodes, or nets, to which each pin connects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Initial PCB Component Placement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is necessary to gather a rough idea about where the components may be found and if there is enough space for all the necessary circuits before moving on the detailed PCB design and layout. This will explain the required number of layers in the board and will enable decisions about whether there is sufficient space for all the circuits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After making a rough guess about the circuit space and their approximate locations, a more detailed component design may be created for PCB layout. This can take into account issues such as proximity of the devices which may need to communicate with each other and other information related to RF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to components to be included in PCB layout, they need to have all the information relevant to themselves. This information will include the area occupied by the printed circuit board pads, any kind of drilling, retention areas and more. Typically, several devices may share the same footprint, therefore there is no need to enter this information for every component number. However, a library will be built for all the devices used in PCB layout design system. In this way, all the components used previously may be easily called.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Routing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the basic placement is completed, the next step of PCB layout is to route all connections between all the components. PCB software then route physical connections on the board according to network listings in the schematic. In order to achieve this, it wil use the available number of layers for connections by creating holes as required. Often, a layer will be allocated to be used as a ground plane and another one as a power plane. Not only this reduce the noise level but also enables low source connections to be made for power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Routing may use a considerable amount of computing power. This is especially valid for larger designs which may include more then three or four thousand components. When the routing is difficult because of high density of components, this may cause Routing take a significant amount of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PCB Files</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information for the photo graphics of PCB layout are output as Gerber files. This format is standard for PCB files and it is a numerical control file form which is used by a photo plotter. In addition to Gerber files, drill information is also generated along with screen print and photo-resist information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main elements in the cost of a printed circuit board is drilling. In any desing, some holes are required for fixing as well as the ones required for any conventinal components. However, to reduce the costs it will be wise to use as few holes as possible. This way, the drill will need changing less and more time will be saved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once complete, PCB information will be used in many areas of manufacturing process. The files may be used for developing a pick and place program and additionally may be used in manufacturing of PCB solder maks in order to add a solder paste to the board prior to component placement. The files also may be used to develop test programs such as &ldquo;In-Circuit Test&rdquo; (ICT) and specifically in development for any kind of nail bed test fixture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this way, PCB layout is a very important element of the whole manufacturing process for any product.

Industrial PCs have higher reliability and precision standards than normal PCs and are generally much more expensive than regular PCs. Usually they use complex instruction sets like x86, otherwise reduced instruction sets like ARM. First Industrial PC produced by IBM which has released 5531 Industrial Computer in 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the technical features of an IPC (industrial PC) and desktop computer such as&nbsp; microprocessor and RAM type, storage medium, interface ports, performance, etc. are actually basically the same. However, the most important feature of industrial PCs is that they are designed to be used in difficult environmental environments such as production facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Industrial computers</strong>&nbsp;mostly used in the following applications to be used in all kinds of applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Evaluation, statistical process control and automatic machine equipment control applications for data collection</li>\r\n	<li>Stand-alone or network controller for data collection applications</li>\r\n	<li>Process equipment, motion control</li>\r\n	<li>Production, cell controllers</li>\r\n	<li>General automation and factory applications</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Difference of Industrial PC and Standard (Desktop or Laptop) Type Computers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>industrial computer</strong>&nbsp;is specifically designed to withstand harsh workshop environment conditions (extreme temperature, dust, humidity, vibration, energy fluctuations) where standard computers cannot be fully qualified. For this reason, an industrial computer should be chosen instead of a normal computer, especially in production environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following principles should be taken into account in the selection of computers for the production areas of industrial computers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Physical Durability</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Temperature:</strong>&nbsp;While normal computers are resistant to 35 &deg; C, industrial computers can operate in environments with ambient temperatures up to 45-50 &deg; C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Liquid / Dust Protection:&nbsp;</strong>For panel PCs, IP66 or at least IP65 protection class should be provided on the outer front surface, and IP21 protection class should be provided for PCs to be used inside box type panels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some models of industrial computers are fanless, some are provided with cooling fans, which are provided with dust protection, with special filters mounted on the casing externally, usually to keep dust and other similar dirt. Dust protection is at a higher level than standard computers, especially thanks to protection classes such as IP65 - IP66.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Memory Units:&nbsp;</strong>Magnetic media (floppy disk, hard disk, CDROM), cooling system components directly and power supply</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shock Impact / Vibration Protection:&nbsp;</strong>Disk drives are mounted with shock absorbers providing cushioning and mechanical insulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Humidity:&nbsp;</strong>Liquid contaminants / coolants frequently used in production and machine environments (sanding machines, machining centers, transfer lines, lathes etc.) negatively affect the computer in the facility. You can reach high relative humidity values with the industrial PC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Supply Unit:&nbsp;</strong>Peak, fluctuating, transient voltages and noise generated by AC power supplies are very common in factory environments. The power supply of computers must be provided under all conditions and always with clean, non-variable DC voltages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Electromagnetic Compatibility:&nbsp;</strong>Proper grounding, protective and proper insulation and electrical design must be provided in accordance with internationally accepted electrical standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Expandability and longevity:&nbsp;</strong>An IPC configuration provides different usage areas compared to the standard PC configuration with the expandable slots it provides. In addition, since they are more durable (for example, varnished motherboards, vibration-proof memory units, SSD (Solid State disks) using MLC (Multi Layer Cell) technology), they have a long working life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Certifications:&nbsp;</strong>Industrial computers must offer certifications in addition to CE certification, which guarantees that they will be less affected by electrical noise in the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Test Reports:&nbsp;</strong>The most important document proving that a computer is industrial is the test reports to be submitted by the manufacturer. Each manufacturer must test its product for heat, vibration, aging, water and dust resistance. It should also be able to present to the customer when requested.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Processor</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When purchasing an industrial computer, criteria such as the strongest and fastest processor and the highest RAM are demanded when purchasing a normal computer. Because the aim is to ensure that it is suitable for the software that will be updated over time. Therefore, users do not hesitate to strain their budgets while purchasing a computer. However, the vast majority of industrial computers do not see updates after they start to work at the point of application and are not used in different areas. For this reason, when choosing an industrial computer, not the top model processor, but a &quot;sufficient&quot; level processor should be selected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, industrial PCs are widely used in many areas, from industrial automation to data collection, from transportation to defense, from kiosks to markets. The development of industrial computers also shows the progress in science and technology. In the future, the industrial market will continue to evolve with increasing expectations. Currently, users are looking for convenience, speed and efficiency. At this point, the answer to the expectation is given by industrial computers.</p>\r\n', 1, 'attachments/blog/what-is-an-industrial-computer.jpeg', 0, '0', '', '', '2022-12-09 13:37:10', 'admin'),
(56, 'WHAT ARE THE PURPOSES OF VEHICLE COMPUTERS', 'what-are-the-purposes-of-vehicle-computers', 'The first computers began to be used in automobiles in the 1970s to perform basic functions such as gearbox shifting and ignition timing.', '<p>The first computers began to be used in automobiles in the 1970s to perform basic functions such as gearbox shifting and ignition timing. In the modern world, vehicles owe their smooth operation to more than 50 microprocessor in-vehicle computers. On-board computers help drivers in a wide range of tasks, from securing the vehicle to saving fuel, from navigation to assisted braking, and make driving fun. This new technology has also saved many lives when it comes to accidents. Vehicles today are rapidly turning into a computer on wheels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what are all these computers in vehicles actually doing? It is possible to divide their aims into a few simple categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vehicle Computers</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Advanced Diagnostics</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest benefits of the large number of sensors and microprocessors in your vehicle are that it is now very easy to determine the causes of problems your vehicle is experiencing. Sensors are used to observe and detect a wide range of different systems, including fuel / air mixture, sparks and much more. When one of these sensors detects any problems, it usually causes an dashboard light, such as a check engine light, to come on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Entertainment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In vehiche computers used in many vehicle entertainment and information systems such as GPS, video games, TVs, Internet radio and bluetooth compatibility. In-vehicle computers are very convenient, for example, to keep children busy or to create a hands-free environment while using your phone or music player, ensuring a safe ride. Today&#39;s on-board computers offer much more than a ride for everyone and also act as a source of entertainment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Safety</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of computers in vehicles has made transportation much safer than before. Airbags, assisted braking, rear view cameras and more are activated by computer sensors that detect problems in the smallest fraction of a second. This is why airbags can be deployed faster than the actual event of the collision.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>ABS</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Automatic braking systems (ABS) are a standard feature on most modern cars. If you don&rsquo;t respond to a sudden braking situation fast enough your ABS works to help you avoid a crash, and reduce the severity of a crash. The system essentially works to have the car&rsquo;s computer take over and brake for the driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Backup Cameras</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Backup cameras are becoming more and more commonplace in the cars on the road. These backup cameras can provide aid to the driver when getting in and out of parking spaces and driveways. These cameras are designed to help drivers avoid backup collisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Emission Controls</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Another great benefit of in-car computers is that they help reduce pollution. Automakers are using in-car computers to ensure less smoke generation, which saves drivers time and money while also helping to protect the environment. On-board computers ensure that regulations for emission and fuel efficiency standards are properly met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the emission laws were passed, it was possible to build a car without a computer. But now, due to the new laws, all vehicles have at least one computer system called ECM. This system is responsible for monitoring engine emissions and adjusting the vehicle engine to keep emission levels low. This system receives the following information from different sensors in the vehicle;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Oxygen Sensor</li>\r\n	<li>Air Pressure Sensor</li>\r\n	<li>Air Temperature Sensor</li>\r\n	<li>Engine Temperature Sensor</li>\r\n	<li>Throttle Position Sensor</li>\r\n	<li>Knock Sensor</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Using information from these different sensors, the on-board computer organizes different systems such as fuel injectors, spark plugs, idle speed, and more. Thanks to these regulations, your vehicle can keep emissions as low as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be said that the automotive industry is experiencing one of the biggest periods of change. There are an increasing number of computers inside vehicles to power new technology, and this trend does not seem to be slowing down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would not be wrong to say that modern vehicles, especially high-quality, luxury vehicles and cars with more features for driver comfort and convenience have now become massive computer systems that drive on wheels. The more comfort you want to have in your car, the more computer technology you need to use.</p>\r\n', 1, 'attachments/blog/what-are-the-purposes-of-vehicle-computers.jpeg', 0, '0', '', '', '2022-12-09 13:37:41', 'admin'),

While there are various types of network devices and applications, in essence a network appliance is simply a cost-saving solution for network management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When configuring a network, a&nbsp;<a href="https://refine-tr.com/en/lanner-products/network-appliances"><strong>network appliances</strong></a>&nbsp;can be used to manage other network-connected devices. Some of the services that are often provided by such an appliance include:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Network Appliances</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Authentication</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important role of any network is to secure remote access to the network and its data. A network appliance can be used for two-factor user authentication to eliminate the need to purchase, install and maintain a separate software-based authentication solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Caching</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a network appliance to store local copies of web pages, videos or other objects will save bandwidth and allow users to access cached content much faster. In some cases, companies also use caching services to track web usage of network users.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>DNS, DHCP, AND IPAM (DDI)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Network appliances</strong>&nbsp;are also often used for critical network services such as DNS, DHCP, and IP address management (collectively known as DDI) to ensure high availability and security for your infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Failover</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If your network is unable to meet downtime or other distruptions, it is necessary to make sure that the network application has failover capabilities. When the device detects an outage in your ISP, the failover should be activated automatically and provide one or more alternative connection methods (a different ISP, cellular, satellite, etc.).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Firewall protection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a&nbsp;<strong>network appliance</strong>&nbsp;for firewall protection allows you to create a barrier between your own network and the internet. Thus, you can monitor incoming and outgoing traffic to your network and easily block unwanted connections according to the criteria you define.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Global WiFi settings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a network device, it is possible to manage settings of wireless networks such as broadcast channel, frequency, bandwidth, load balancing, access point and security.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Intrusion detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Malicious activity is extremely common and using a network appliance to detect intrusion is of paramount importance. The application will monitor and report activity and policy violations. Intrusion detection, unlike the firewall service, can also alert you to malicious activity on your network.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Network Appliance Management</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A network device is usually managed through a browser interface, allowing network administrators to manage their services from anywhere and get up-to-date reports whenever they want.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Network Appliance Benefits</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several advantages to using a network device rather than using general purpose servers or computers:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Easy to deploy, operate and manage</li>\r\n	<li>Compatible with almost any network connected device</li>\r\n	<li>Purposeful in optimizing performance, security and scalability</li>\r\n	<li>Cost effective</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Each network is unique in its infrastructure, needs, and vulnerabilities.

More specifically, network devices act as intermediaries for data transfer in a computer network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The equipment range of network devices is extremely wide. These equipment may include core network components that serve to interconnect other network components, hybrid components, and hardware or software components located at different ports of the network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Network devices can be classified according to their location and role in the network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To briefly introduce the most commonly used and most well-known components among these;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Gateaway</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be said that Gateaway is a network hardware that provides communication between data between two networks through different network protocols. We can also think of Gateaway as an interpreter who helps two people who do not speak the same language or have difficulty communicating to understand each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Router</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Router is a network device that establishes and directs communication between two networks. We can define this as the seamless delivery of a data packet from one station to another. Routers can be considered among the most important computer network equipment that maintains network traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Switch</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Network Switch, also known as Switch, is one of the network devices that allow computers and other network components to be connected to each other. It helps different nodes on the network to communicate in a healthy and direct way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bridge</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a network device that connects two computer networks into one. It is mostly used to connect ethernet or token-ring-based networks. It can act as a hardware on its own, as well as act as a bridge with a suitable software or operating system support.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hub</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The hub is tasked with connecting multiple computer network devices together. It also works as a repeater to amplify distorted signals. There are two types of Hubs; simple and multi-port.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Firewall</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Firewall is a hardware-based network security system that controls outbound packet traffic to the network based on a rule set. With many different filtering features, it keeps the internet traffic of the computer and the network, including incoming and outgoing packets, under control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a solid knowledge and understanding of networking devices can enable you to design and implement a network that serves you well, for your personal or corporate purposes. To ensure the security and usefulness of the network, you must monitor the network equipment very closely.

It can connect to multiple clouds using internet connections, thus providing a scalable solution for growing businesses. The system delivers data directly to the connection source, eliminating the need for an enterprise data center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what benefits does&nbsp;<strong>SASE</strong>&nbsp;provide us in our business?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cost Reduction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With SASE, businesses can offer more services and technologies through a single service provider instead of two or more, thus reducing the cost of device and unnecessary network complexity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reducing network complexity means reducing the workload of IT staff. Therefore, SASE significantly reduces IT staffing costs while providing continuous coverage for network performance monitoring and security threat monitoring and response. SASE will also significantly reduce the operational load, as it does not require investment in new hardware and software.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>WAN Flexibility and IT Agility</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SASE</strong>&nbsp;provides great flexibility within the WAN infrastructure. While traditional solutions require a lot of time and resources to scale up and down, a cloud-based SASE solution minimizes the IT burden, making procurement processes as easy as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using SASE, IT can get a site online in minutes instead of weeks as on a traditional WAN. It also means less physical hardware need, less downtime and fewer additional software licenses. With these enhanced efficiencies, IT can assign staff to higher priority tasks such as security and network monitoring.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Increased Security</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SASE</strong>&nbsp;improves security in a variety of ways. First, you can block or restrict access to certain data by applying data protection methods. SASE can also make your network fully visible. In addition to all this, SASE can successfully fulfill its task of securely connecting IoT devices, which normally have a minimum of security.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Improving Network Performance</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>SASE&#39;s continuous network monitoring reveals the quality and performance of all connections, including virtual cloud environments and those in the data center.&nbsp;<strong>SASE</strong>&nbsp;paints a real-time picture of all inbound and outbound connections on a single portal or network interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Greater Transparency and Visibility</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Network risk assessment can be an extremely complex and ongoing process. The environment will constantly change as connections are initiated and disconnected. What organizations need to do here is to try to understand and solve the interactions of their users, devices, applications and services, thereby minimizing the risk.&nbsp;<strong>SASE</strong>&nbsp;also comes into play here and gathers a multitude of functions in a single point, thus providing network and security transparency. This transparency is a very important detail for organizations as it will reduce the number of software agents needed and provide consistent network visibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, data is dispersed beyond a local data center as cloud services and remote work are becoming more common. For this reason, it has become a mandatory situation for companies to secure their data in every environment.&nbsp;<strong>SASE</strong>&nbsp;offers an extremely efficient and easy way to overcome this security issue. With its simplification of WAN deployment and the solid security measures it provides,&nbsp;<strong>SASE</strong>&nbsp;is a very important solution for all companies in this period.</p>\r\n', 1, 'attachments/blog/what-is-sase-what-are-the-benefits-for-your-business.jpeg', 0, '0', '', '', '2022-12-09 13:39:30', 'admin'),

Thus it will perform all the functions that a piece of hardware performs. Therefore, the software can emulate a desktop PC on a server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is exactly what cloud-based IT service provides: A space where jobs can be performed and stored without the need for on-premises hardware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Virtualization in cloud computing can be divided into 6 main categories;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Server Virtualization</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With this method, the server space is protected by combining multiple machines into a single server running multiple virtual environments. It is a method which businesses can run the same applications on multiple servers, thereby creating a &quot;fail-safe&quot; position. Even though the machines have different operating systems, each server is independent, so server environments can be moved from one place to another. The savings on hardware is the most obvious benefit of this method.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Data Virtualization</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Data virtualization</strong>&nbsp;is an approach to data management that allows an application to retrieve and manipulate data without requiring technical details about the data, such as how it is formatted at source, or where it is physically located and can provide a single customer view (or single view of any other entity) of the overall data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Network Virtualization</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Network virtualization</strong>&nbsp;is the process of combining hardware and software network resources and network functionality into a virtual network that is a single software-based management entity. Network virtualization includes platform virtualization, often combined with resource virtualization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Storage Virtualization</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In this method, the servers do not know exactly where their data is stored and instead act like worker bees in a hive. Storage Virtualization enables data from many sources to be managed and used as if it were in a single repository.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;software thus provides a smooth operation process, consistency in performance and enhanced functionality, despite any equipment changes or malfunctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Desktop Virtualization</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike other methods, this method simulates the load of a workstation rather than a server and allows this user to access the desktop remotely. Because the workstation runs on a data center server, access to it can be both more secure and portable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Application Virtualization</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Application Virtualization</strong>&nbsp;helps users access applications remotely. The server stores all the features of the application and all personal information, but can still run on a local workstation over the internet. An example of this is a user who needs to run two different versions of the same software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Virtualization software allows you to run multiple operating systems and applications simultaneously on the same server. This will lower a company&#39;s existing hardware costs and thus increase its productivity. It would not be wrong to say that virtualization is the basic technology that powers cloud computing.

(61, 'WITH WHICH DEVICES DO YOU ENSURE YOUR NETWORK SECURITY?', 'with-which-devices-do-you-ensure-your-network-security', 'With the digital age dominating our lives and the increasing interest in technology, data security has become an even more priority issue.', '<p>With the digital age dominating our lives and the increasing interest in technology, data security has become an even more priority issue. Although new methods of data security are found and existing methods are tried to be improved, cyber threats are becoming more and more scary every day. The only way to get rid of these threats is to strengthen Network security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Network security can be defined as preventive measures taken to protect the network infrastructure against unwanted changes, malfunctions, destruction of data and unauthorized access. Various devices are used to take these precautions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A network security strategy should focus on three main points: Protection, detection and response. Protection encompasses all tools designed to counter any threat to network security and prevent unauthorized access. Detection refers to resources that enable to analyze network traffic and identify problems quickly. Response is the ability to react to identified threats and quickly resolve them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So,&nbsp;<strong>with which devices will we ensure Network Security</strong>? Let&#39;s take a look at a few of the most used methods</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first and most important tool is&nbsp;<strong>Firewall</strong>. Firewalls are security control software / devices between your local network and the external network. Information such as which data packets will pass and which passwords will be passed within the pre-determined policies, and which passwords will be verified are added to the firewall rule tables. In this way, the person and information traffic reaching the system is taken under control. The rules on the firewall determine who can and cannot enter the inside / outside systems, which computers and which services can be used by those who enter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our second device is&nbsp;<strong>VPN</strong>, in other words&nbsp;<strong>Virtual Private Networks</strong>. Virtual private network or vpn is an Internet technology that enables connection to different networks through remote access. Because VPN creates a virtual network extension, a device connected to the network using VPN can exchange data over that network as if it were physically connected. Thanks to VPN, we can both reduce our costs and move PCs and LANs in different places, which we could not do because they were previously unsafe and expensive, to the same platforms over the internet. In this way, it is possible for us to connect to our company while at home, access company resources, check our e-mails and use the Intranet as if we were there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another security measure is to use an&nbsp;<strong>Antivirus Software</strong>. Antivirus software, or antivirus software, also known as anti-malware, is a computer program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware. E-mail, http and ftp traffic, which are the services where viruses are most spread, are directed to the antivirus gateway based on the firewall logic. After the scanning process here, it is directed to the necessary places. With this system, viruses from outside are prevented. With the antivirus system installed on mail servers, viruses circulating in the local network via e-mail are deactivated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, one of the very effective defense methods is to use&nbsp;<strong>IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)</strong>. IDS (Intrusion Detection System) generally appears in two types; Server based IDS and Network based IDS. Intrusion Detection Systems continuously scan network traffic and analyze the results. In this way, any type of attack can be identified and responded quickly. IDS usually maintains a database of known attack methods to be able to quickly recognize attacks and threats and take quick action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another powerful tool we can use for network protection is&nbsp;<strong>Anomaly Detection</strong>. Network Anomaly Detection Engines, in other words ADE, allow the network to be analyzed so that if any breach occurs in the network, we are alerted quickly enough to respond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we can mention&nbsp;<strong>Network Segmentation</strong>&nbsp;as an important Network security measure. There are many types of network traffic, each associated with different security risks. Network Segmentation allows us to reach the right traffic without risk while limiting the traffic from risky and suspicious sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reliable network security software and hardware, combined with the right policies and smart strategies, can minimize the impact of cyberattacks and eliminate concerns about Network security.</p>\r\n', 1, 'attachments/blog/with-which-devices-do-you-ensure-your-network-security.jpeg', 0, '0', '', '', '2022-12-09 13:40:28', 'admin');
